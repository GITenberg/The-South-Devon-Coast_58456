</div>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">INTRODUCTORY</span></h2>

<p>If the map of Devon be measured across in a
straight line, it will be found that, from Lyme
Regis, where it joins Dorsetshire, to King’s
Tamerton on the River Tamar, where Devonshire
at its westernmost extremity looks across to
Saltash, in Cornwall, South Devon is fifty-five
miles across. That line, however, would miss
quite two-thirds of the coast, and would pass so
far inland as Ashburton, on the borders of Dartmoor;
the profile of the South Devon Coast
exhibiting a remarkably bold and rugged south-westerly
trend out of a straight line, westward of
the Exe, and an almost equally bold north-westerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
direction after passing Prawle Point. The actual
coast-line is therefore very much greater, and is
prolonged by the many important estuaries and
their subsidiary arms; such, for example, as
that of the Exe, which is navigable as far as the
port of Exeter, nine miles from the open sea;
the Teign, four miles; the Dart, nine miles;
Kingsbridge River, seven miles; the Avon, three
miles; the Erme, two miles; the Yealm, four
miles; and the Hamoaze and Tamar, from
Devonport to Calstock, ten miles. In one way
and another, the South Devon Coast, tracing the
creeks and the coastguard-paths, is not less than
one hundred and eighty-nine miles in length.</p>

<p>It is a historic coast, and plentifully marked
with towns and villages; with this result, that it
is by no means to be treated of shortly. Devon
has produced fully her share of great men, and
many of them have been born within sight and
sound of the sea; while the mere mention of
Torquay, Brixham, Dartmouth, and Plymouth,
recalls, not merely local annals, but prominent
events in the history of England.</p>

<p>As the South Devon Coast is the most beautiful
of coasts, so is it also among the most hilly. One
hesitates to say that it is not the coast for exploring
by means of a cycle, but certainly those
who perform their touring in that sort must expect
severe gradients, and must not anticipate, even
so, an uninterrupted view of the actual coast;
for there are many and considerable stretches along
which you come to the sea only by unrideable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
footpaths. The pedestrian alone can explore
this seaboard thoroughly, and he will find, in the
tourist season, at least, that his progress is limited
by the climate, which not infrequently in the
months of July and August, resembles the moist
and enervating heat of the great Palm House in
Kew Gardens.</p>

<p>Lyme Regis, whence this exploration starts,
is at the very door of Devonshire, and was, indeed,
in recent years within an ace of being transferred
from Dorset. At Lyme, which lies, as it were,
at the bottom of a cup, you perceive at once the
sort of thing in store for those who would fare
westward: exquisite scenery combined with
extravagantly steep roads.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">ROUSDON—THE DOWLANDS LANDSLIP</span></h2>

<p>Close by the border-line of the two counties, as
you make from Lyme Regis, across the pleasant
upland meadows to Uplyme, which is in Devonshire,
is Middle Mill. The mill has seen its best
days and no longer grinds corn, and the great
wheel is idle, for the very excellent reason that
the stream that once sent it ponderously revolving
has been diverted. The thatched mill-house and
its adjoining cottage, together with the silent
wheel are, in short, in that condition of picturesque
decay which spells romance to artists, who, discovering
it, cannot resist a sketch. It appealed
irresistibly, some years ago, to an artist in another
craft; to none other, in short, than that distinguished
novelist, Sir Walter Besant, who laid the
scenes of his eighteenth-century story, <i>’Twas in
Trafalgar’s Bay</i>, chiefly here and at Rousdon.</p>

<p>He describes Middle Mill just as it is situated:
“At the back of the mill was an orchard, where
the pink and red cider apples looked pleasant—they
could not look sweet. Beyond the orchard
was a piggery, and then you came to the bed of a
stream, which was dry in summer, save for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
little green damp among the stones, by the side
of which was a coppice of alder-trees, and behind
the alders a dark, deep wood, into which you
might peer all a summer’s day and dream boundless
things.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus4">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MIDDLE MILL.</p>
</div>

<p>The only objection that can be taken to the
verisimilitude of this description is the reference
to the cider apples. As a matter of fact, they do
look sweet—and are not. The novelist refers
to the richly ruddy “Devonshire reds,” whose
beautiful colour presupposes in the mind of
strangers to cider-apples a fruit luxuriously sweet
and juicy. Devonshire farmers take little care
to fence their cider-apples from the stranger, who
steals and tastes as a rule only one, finding with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the first bite that sweetness is by no means necessarily
housed within that captivating exterior.</p>

<p>The story is one of smuggling and of rival
loves. At Middle Mill lived the miserly Joshua
Meech, whose unrequited affection for Pleasance
Noel, and whose revengeful jealousy, bring about
all the trouble. To punish him for his betrayal
of his friends to the Revenue Officers, Pleasance
by night steals eight bags of his hoarded wealth
from under the hearthstone, where Joshua kept
his domestic bank, and hides them under the millwheel.
The wheel “stood there, under a broad,
sloping penthouse of heavy thatch, which made it
dark in the brightest day”; and so you may
find it, exactly as described, except that the
penthouse is tiled, and not thatched.</p>

<p>The actual coast, for the six miles between
Lyme Regis and Seaton is a roadless, and in parts
an almost trackless, stretch of strenuous clambering
among rocks and tangled thickets; among
landslips old and new, and undercliffs overgrown
with such a wilderness of trees and shrubs and
bracken, and blackberry brakes as only Devon
can produce. But for all these difficulties, perhaps
because of them, the way is preferable to
the hard high road that goes, a little way inland.
Here, at least, “exploration” is no straining after
effect, no misuse of the word.</p>

<p>When you have left the Cobb at Lyme Regis
behind and passed the coastguard station, you
have come to sheer wildness; the deserted
cement works, standing amid a waste of wrecked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
earthy cliffs, themselves forming a not inappropriate
prelude to the perfect abandonment of
nature. Here the low promontory of Devonshire
Point ends the Ware Cliffs; and the tangle, with
the gaping fissures between the rock and earth
half hidden by grass and bushes, becomes so
nearly impenetrable as to render a retreat up along
the boulders into Holmbush Fields absolutely
necessary; Holmbush Fields, with their rustic
stiles and hedgerow timber, and the winding footpath
across, giving a sober and graceful interlude;
and then you come upon a mile or so of wonderful
pathway, roughly shaped amid the wild jungle
that here has overgrown a tract of oozy and boggy
undercliff, formed by a century or more of continual
landslides. There surely is no more beautiful
wilderness of the particular type in England,
than this: a very great deal of its beauty being
due to the happy circumstance that neither Lyme
Regis nor Seaton are as yet large enough to admit
of it being overrun. Hardy pioneers have beaten
out the devious pathway, and the few who have
followed in their footsteps have kept it from
being again overgrown. Spring—the month of
May—is the ideal time for this part of the coast;
when the birds have again wakened to song, and
the young foliage is tender and the landsprings
have not been dried up.</p>

<p>Even the pioneers have not made all the way
easy; for you come at last to what Devonshire
people call “zoggy plaaces,” where the willow
and hazel bushes stand in mossy ground, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
primroses grow an unwonted size, by reason of
the excessive moisture. Here you must calculate
every step and nicely test the mossy hummocks
before fully trusting them; finally emerging upon
an open plain midway between the sea below and
tall cliffs above; a plain where rocks of every
shape and size have been hurled down in extraordinary
confusion. Here the explorer requires
not a little of the suppleness and agility of the
chamois, and growing at last weary of bounding
hazardously from crag to crag, climbs with
extraordinary labour, past monstrous grey, ivy-grown
spires and pinnacles of limestone, up a
winding footpath in the face of the cliff, to where
the Whitlands Coastguard station looks down
upon the tumbled scene. From this point the
coastguard-path lies along the cliffs’ edge, to
where the cliffs die down to the waterside in the
deep coombe in whose woods the sea comes
lapping at Charton Bay. Here a limekiln, that
looks romantic enough for a castle, stands on the
beach, with the dense woods climbing backwards,
and on the skyline the roofs and tower and
chimneys of Rousdon.</p>

<p class="caption">ROUSDON.</p>
</div>

<p>Rousdon is a remarkable place. It shows
you what may be done in the wholesale grocery
way of business, for the estate was enclosed, and
the great mansion built by Sir Henry Peek,
between 1871 and 1883. When that wealthy
baronet set about becoming a landed proprietor
here, he found a wild expanse stretching down
from the high land by the main road between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Lyme and Seaton, toward the sea, and he enclosed
some two hundred and fifty acres, and on the
upper part built a magnificent house, whose
beauties we will not stop to describe in this place,
because, if a beginning were made with it, and
the collections of various sorts within, it would
be no easy task to conclude. He found here, amid
these solitudes, the ruinous little church of St. Pancras,
of Rousdon, used as the outhouse of a farm.
Its rector was an absentee, not greatly needed,
for the entire parish numbered but sixteen persons,
all employed on the farm itself. A new church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
was built in the grounds, and a member of the
Peek family appointed rector; and thus we see
the remarkable spectacle of a parish as self-contained
as any box of sardines; with the whole of
the inhabitants employed upon the estate, and
free trade in religion abolished. I think no
monarchy is quite so absolute.</p>

<p>A remarkable feature of Rousdon mansion is
the extensive use, internally, of Sicilian marble.
The great staircase, and other portions of the
house are built of it, and a beautiful dairy is
wholly decorated with this material. It came
here in a romantic and wholly unexpected way;
having been the cargo of a ship wrecked on the
rocks off Rousdon at the time when plans for the
building were being made.</p>

<p>By more undercliff footpaths you come at
length, through the steamy hollows of Rousdon,
to that “lion” of this district, the great Dowlands
landslip, an immense wedge of cliff and agricultural
land that on the Christmas night of 1839 suddenly
parted its moorings with the mainland and made
for the sea, halting before quite immersing itself,
and ever since presenting the extraordinary spectacle
of a jagged gorge winding between two
sheer walls of cliff, with weird isolated limestone
pillars, from one to two hundred feet in height,
thrusting up here and there. It is the Landscape
of Dream, and only saved from being that of
nightmare by the soft beauty of the enshrouding
verdure that has clothed the place since then.
The well-known landslip in the Isle of Wight is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
altogether smaller and inferior to this: and more
hackneyed.</p>

<p>The cause of this extraordinary happening is
found in the geological features of this immediate
neighbourhood; the limestone and other rock
resting on a deep stratum of sand, which in its
turn was based on blue clay. Springs percolating
through the sand were probably obstructed, and
the water found its way in unusual quantities to
the blue clay, which in course of time became one
vast butterslide, and thus brought about a landslip
that engulfed fields and orchards, and sunk
two cottages, unharmed fortunately, to a level
one hundred and seventy feet lower than they had
before occupied.</p>

<p>A charge of sixpence is attempted at a farm
at the Seaton end, to view this remarkable place,
and it is worth an entrance-fee; but explorers
coming from Lyme Regis are not unlikely to
stumble into the place, unaware; and in any case
the attempt is an impudent and illegal imposition,
for the question of free access was fought out
successfully some years ago by the Lyme Regis
corporation.</p>

</div>

<p>Word-painting is all very well as a pastime,
but the result makes poor reading. We will,
therefore, not emulate the local guide-books;
which, to be sure, transcend the descriptive art
so greatly as to come out at the other end, as
works of unconscious humour. Thus, when in
those pages we read of “Dame Nature,” and “Old
Father Time,” working these miracles of landslides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
we get a mental picture of a stupendous old couple
that fairly takes the breath away. Moreover,
the scene is compared with “the island home of
Robinson Crusoe,” and likened to “the wildness
of Salvator Rosa or the fairy scenes of Claude,”
while “the huge boulders you can convert into
sphinxes,” and find “deep and thickly wooded
dingles, in which lions and tigers could lurk
unseen.” Still more, we read: “If you give full
scope to your imagination, you may fancy that
the pale moonlight would inhabit the ruins with
the spirits of those who lived in the ages of
mythology.” In short, if these directions are
faithfully followed, and these lions and tigers
and these spirits of mythological creatures—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
“Mrs. Harrises” of ancient times—are duly conjured
up, the too-imaginative explorer is likely to
emerge fully qualified for a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>The exceptional beauty of the scene does not
require any of these fantastical aids to appreciation,
and the hoar ivied rocks, the fairy glades,
the brakes and willow woods are sufficient in
themselves.</p>

<p>The mile-long beauty of the great Dowlands
Landslip having been traversed, the way lies
across the down over Haven Cliff, the striking
headland that shuts in Seaton from the east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">SEATON</span></h2>

<p>Down there lies Seaton, looking very new, along
the inner side of a shingly beach, with the strath
of the river Axe running, flat and green, up inland
to the distant hills, and the silvery Axe itself
looping and twisting away, as far as eye can reach.</p>

<p>But Seaton is not so new as might be supposed.
Down there, on the wall that runs along the crest
of the beach, is painted in huge black letters the
one word <span class="smcap">Moridunum</span>, which to passengers coming
in by steamboat seems the most prominent feature
in the place, and at first sight is generally taken
to be the impudent advertisement of some new
quack electuary, tooth-paste, hair-wash, or what
not? “Use Moridunum,” you unconsciously say,
“and be sure you get it”; or “Moridunum for
the hair,” “Moridunum: won’t wash clothes,”
and so forth. Seaton claims—and, it is evident,
claims it boldly—to be the <i>Moridunum</i> of Roman
Britain; but is it? In short, seeking it here,
<i>have</i> you got it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus7">

<p class="caption">SEATON: MOUTH OF THE AXE</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>That is a question which various warring
schools of antiquaries would dearly like settled.
The Roman grip upon Britain weakened greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
as it came westward, and Roman roads in Devon
are few and uncertain. The famous <i>Antonine
Itinerary</i>—that most classic of all road-books—gives
but one station between <i>Durnovaria</i>, Dorchester,
and <i>Isca Damnoniorum</i>, Exeter. That
is <i>Moridunum</i>, this ancient and well-gnawed bone
of contention. The name was a Roman adaptation,
either of the British <i>Mor-y-dun</i> or sea-town,
or <i>Mawr-y-dun</i>, “great hill-fort”; which, it is
impossible to say. All depends upon which of
two routes was selected to Exeter. If it was the
inland route, the likelihood rests with the great
hill-top Roman camp at Hembury, near Honiton;
while if it was the way by Axminster and Sidmouth,
then Seaton or High Peak, Sidmouth, is
the site.</p>

<p>Whatever may some day prove to be the
solution of the mystery, it is certain, from remains
of Roman villas discovered near Seaton, that it
was a favourite place of residence; and therefore
it is not so new as it looks. Indeed, in days
long gone by, before the mouth of the River Axe
had been well-nigh choked with shingle, Seaton
and the now tiny village of Axmouth, a mile
up-stream, were ports. “Ther hath beene,” said
Leland, writing in the reign of Henry the Eighth,
“a very notable haven at Seton. But now ther
lyith between the two pointes of the old haven
a mighty rigge and barre of pible stones in the
very mouth of it.”</p>

<p>The mighty ridge is still here, and has acquired
so permanent a character that part of modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Seaton is built on it, while cattle graze on the
pastures that grow where the ships used to ride
at anchor.</p>

<p>The place was become in Leland’s time a
“mene fisschar town.” “It hath,” he continued,
“beene far larger when the haven was good;”
and so, looking at the ancient church, away back
from the sea, it would seem.</p>

<p>Many attempts were made to cut a passage
through the shingle, but what the labourers
removed, the sea replaced with other. The last
attempt was about 1830, when John Hallett of
Stedcombe dug a channel and built a quay at
the very mouth of the river, under the towering
mass of Haven Cliff. Modern Seaton should
gratefully erect a statue to this endeavourer, for
thus he kept the tiny port going, and the coals
and timber that would have then been so costly
by land carriage came cheaply to his quays.
Then, after a while, came the railway, and his
wharves were deserted. There, under the cliff,
they remain to this day, and the little custom-house
has been converted into a kind of seashore
bathing-place and belvedere, attached to the
beautiful residence of Stedcombe, nestling on the
bosom of the down.</p>

<p>When a branch railway was opened to Seaton,
in 1868, the town began to grow. A very slow
growth at first, but in the last few years it has
expanded suddenly into a thriving town, and the
astonished visitor in these latter days perceives
such amazing developments as a giant hotel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a theatre; and if he be a visitor over Sunday, will
observe the might and majesty of railways exercised
in the bringing down from London of day
trippers, who set out from Waterloo at an unimaginably
early hour and are dumped down
upon Seaton beach at midday. He will witness
scrambling hordes, indecently thirsty, besieging
the refreshment-places of the town, and if he be
a Superior Person, will, with tumultuous feelings
of relief, see the crowded train-load depart as the
summer evening draws in and the church-bells
begin to chime. The sheer Average Man, however,
who witnesses this Sunday irruption, will merely
wonder how any one can find it worth while to
expend six shillings on an excursion ticket, entitling
him to make a double journey of three
hundred and four miles and fourteen hours, solely
for the fleeting pleasure of five hours on a shingly
beach.</p>

<p>What renders that excursion so popular?
Well, partly a love of nature, and very greatly
that love of a bargain which makes many keen
people purchase what they do not want. It is
quite conceivable that there are many people who
would want to be <i>paid</i> a great deal more than
six shillings for the discomfort of fourteen hours
railway travel on a Sunday.</p>

<p>The dominant note of Seaton is its apparent
newness. From the golf links and the club-house
on the down by Haven Cliff on the east, to Seaton
Hole on the west, it looks a creation of yesterday,
and the casual visitor is incredulous when told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of a fourteenth-century parish church. But such
a building exists, nearly a mile inland, with a
hoary tower and curious monuments; among
them one to “Abraham Sydenham, Salt Officer
for 40 years”: an inscription reminiscent of the
old salt-pans industry in the levels by the Axe,
and of the long-forgotten salt-tax. That most
famous smuggler of the West of England, Jack
Rattenbury, lies in Seaton churchyard, but no
stone marks the spot.</p>

<p>Seaton Hole, just mentioned, is the innermost
nook of Seaton Bay, just under the great mass of
White Cliff; called white only relatively to the
surrounding cliffs, which are red. White Cliff,
in fact, is rather light browns and greys, with
masses of green vegetation, and incidental whitish
streaks. Here is the exclusive part of Seaton,
with a fine bathing-beach, and numbers of very
fine new residences—not merely houses, mark
you—cresting the best view-points. And up-along
and over the hill, ever so steeply, and then down,
still more steeply, and you are at Beer.</p>

<span class="smaller">JACK RATTENBURY, SMUGGLER—BEER</span></h2>

<p>The name of Beer is famous in smuggling annals,
for it was in the then rather desperate little fisher-village
that Jack Rattenbury, smuggler, who
lies in Seaton churchyard was born, in 1778.
Smugglers and highwaymen in general are figures
that loom dimly in the pages of history, and, like
figures seen in a fog, bulk a good deal larger than
they ought. But the famous Jack Rattenbury
is an exception. He does not, when we come to
close quarters with him, diminish into an undersized,
overrated breaker of laws. Instead, he
grows bigger, the more you learn: and a great
deal may be learned of him, for he printed and
published the story of his life in 1837.</p>

<p>It seems that he was the son of a Beer shoemaker,
who, by going for a sailor and never being
heard of again, vindicated the wisdom of that
proverb which advises the cobbler to stick to his
last. Young Jack Rattenbury never knew his
father. He began his adventures at nine years
of age, as boy on a fishing-smack, and then became
one of the crew of a privateer which set out from
Brixham during the war with France and Spain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to prey upon the enemy: meeting instead, at
the very outset, with a French frigate, with the
unexpected result that privateer and crew were
speedily taken, as prize and prisoners, to Bordeaux.
Escaping on an American ship, he at
last reached home again, and engaged for a time
in fishing. But fishing was poor employment
for an adventurous spirit, and Rattenbury soon
found his way into smuggling. He first took
part in the exploits of a Lyme Regis boat, trading
in that illegitimate way to the Channel Islands,
and then found more lawful employment on a
brig called <i>The Friends</i>, of Beer and Seaton. But
the very first trip was disastrous. Sailing from
Bridport to Tenby, for culm, he again experienced
capture: by a French privateer on this occasion.
The privateer put a prize-crew of four men on
the brig, with orders to take her to the nearest
French port. “Then,” says Rattenbury, “when
the privateer was gone, the prize-master ordered
me to go aloft and loose the main-topgallant sail.
When I came down, I perceived that he was
steering very wildly, through ignorance of the
coast, and I offered to take the helm, to which
he consented, and directed me to steer south-east
by north. He then went below, and was engaged
in drinking and carousing with his companions.
They likewise sent me up a glass of grog occasionally,
which animated my spirits, and I began to
conceive a hope, not only of escaping, but also of
being revenged on the enemy.”</p>

<p>The artful Rattenbury then steered up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Portland, and when the master asked what land
it was, replied “Alderney.” Presently they came
off St. Aldhelm’s Head, and were distinctly suspicious
when told it was Cape La Hogue.</p>

<p>“We were now within a league of Swanage,
and I persuaded them to go on shore to get a
pilot. They then hoisted out a boat, into which
I got with three of them. We now came so near
shore that people hailed us. My companions
began to swear, and said the people spoke English.
This I denied, and urged them to hail again; but
as they were rising to do so, I plunged overboard,
and came up the other side of the boat. They
then struck at me with their oars, and snapped a
pistol at me, but it missed fire. The boat in
which they were now took water, and finding they
were engaged in a vain pursuit, they rowed away
as fast as possible, to regain the vessel.”</p>

<p>Rattenbury swam ashore and sent messengers,
with the result that the <i>Nancy</i>, revenue cutter,
went in pursuit of the brig and, recapturing her,
brought her into Cowes the same night.</p>

<p>He was then forcibly enlisted in the Navy by
the Press Gang, and, escaping from His Majesty’s
service, went cod-fishing off Newfoundland. Returning,
the ship he was on was captured by a
Spanish privateer and taken into Vigo. Escaping
with his usual dexterity, he reached home and
added another thrilling item to his hazardous
career by getting married, April 17th, 1801.
After a quiet interval of piloting, he resumed
smuggling, in earnest; with the usual ups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and downs of fortune incidental to that shy
trade.</p>

<p>Having made several successful voyages, and
feeling pretty confident, he went ashore to carouse
with some friends in one of the old taverns of
Beer. In the same room were a sergeant and
several privates of the South Devon Militia,
among others. “After drinking two or three
pots of beer,” he says, “the sergeant, whose name
was Hill, having heard my name mentioned by
some of my companions, went out with his men,
and soon they returned again, having armed
themselves with swords and muskets. The sergeant
then advanced towards me and said, ‘You
are my prisoner. You are a deserter, and must
go along with me.’ For a moment I was much
terrified, knowing that if I was taken I should, in
all probability, be obliged to go aboard the fleet;
and this wrought up my mind to a pitch of desperation.
I endeavoured, however, to keep as
cool as possible, and in answer to his charge, I
said, ‘Sergeant, you are surely labouring under
an error; I have done nothing that can authorise
you in taking me up or detaining me. You must
certainly have mistaken me for some other
person.’”</p>

<p>This shows us, pretty clearly, that some one
must have written Rattenbury’s reminiscences
for him. He probably was incapable of such
book-English, and certainly would not have
spoken anything else than the broadest of Devonshire
speech. However, he describes how he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
drew the sergeant into a parley and how, while
it was going on, he jumped through a trap-door
into the cellar. “I then threw off my jacket and
shirt, to prevent any one from holding me, and
having armed myself with a reaping-hook and a
knife, which I had in my pocket, I threw myself
into an attitude of defence at the entrance, which
was a half-hatch door, the lower part of which I
shut, and then declared that I would kill the first
man that came near me, and that I would not be
taken from the spot alive. At this the sergeant
was evidently terrified; but he said to his men,
‘Soldiers, do your duty; advance and seize him.’
To which they replied, ‘Sergeant, you proposed
it; take the lead and set us an example, and we
will follow.’ No one offered to advance, and I
remained in the position I have described for four
hours, holding them at bay.”</p>

<p>The sergeant sent for aid, but before that
arrived the women of Beer rushed in with an artful
story of shipwreck, attracting the soldiers’ attention.
Rattenbury, seizing the opportunity,
dashed among them, half-naked, and escaped to
the beach, where he hastily took boat and went
off to his own vessel, and safety.</p>

<p>In 1806 he, his crew, and his cargo of spirit-tubs
were captured by the <i>Duke of York</i> cutter, when
returning from Alderney. He was fined £100,
and with his companions was sentenced to the
alternative of imprisonment or service on board
a man-o’-war. They chose the sea, and were
accordingly shipped aboard the brig <i>Kate</i>, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Downs; but soon, while the officers were all more
or less drunk, he found an opportunity of escaping,
and was presently home again.</p>

<p>The smuggling exploits of this master of the
art were endless. Perhaps the most amusing—to
the reader, at any rate—is that incident at
Seaton Hole, where, one dark night, going up the
cliff with a keg on his back, one of a cargo he had
just landed, he was so unfortunate as to stumble
over a donkey, which began to bray so horribly
that, what with his trumpeting and the noise
of the smuggler’s fall, a Revenue officer, sleeping
at the post of duty, was aroused, and seized
forty kegs, nearly the whole of that run.</p>

<p>After serving three terms of imprisonment
for smuggling, and for being unable to pay a fine
of £4,500, Rattenbury’s many adventures came
to an end in 1833. His later years were devoted
to fishing and piloting, and between whiles, to
composing his reminiscences. In those pages
you read this rather pitiful little note: “The
smuggler gratefully acknowledges the kindness
of the Right Honourable Lord Rolle, who now
allows him one shilling per week for life.” What
lavish generosity!</p>

<p>That was a picturesque village in which this
Old Master and prime exponent of smuggling
lived. The one street led steeply down to the sea,
with a clear rivulet purling along the gutter, with
quaint pumps at intervals and bordered by cob
cottages. The peasant women sat at the doors
making the pillow-lace of Devonshire, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
children, for lack of better toys, played the
great game of “shop” with the fish-offal in the
kennel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus9">
<img src="images/illus9.jpg" width="400" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BEER.</p>
</div>

<p>But the old Beer of this picture has vanished,
and a new and smart village has arisen in its
stead, with just two or three of these characteristic
survivals, to make us the more bitterly regret
that which we have lost. The place that was so
inspiring for the artist has become an impossibility
for him, except, at the cost of veracity, he dodges
the Philistine surroundings of those surviving
“bits.” One little circumstance shall show you
how artificial this sometime unconventional and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
simple village has become. When it was the
haunt of painters, there was none who loved
Beer so much as, or visited it more constantly
than, Hamilton Macallum, who died here, aged
fifty-five, in 1896. He had endeared himself to
the people, and they and some of his brother
artists combined to set up the bronze tablet to
his memory that stands in the tiny pleasure-ground
or public garden in the village street.
And here is the sorry humour of it, that shows
the damnable artificiality of the times, which
has spoiled so much of Old England. The “public
garden” is kept locked through the winter and
the spring, lest the children go in and spoil it;
and only thrown open when the brief visitors’
season begins. There could be no more bitter
indictment.</p>

<p>There was once a humble little church in this
same street of Beer. A very humble church,
but in keeping with the place. And now? Why
a large and highly ornate building, infinitely
pretentious and big enough for a cathedral, has
arisen on the site of it. It is, however, still in
keeping with Beer, for as deep calls unto deep,
so across this narrow street pretentiousness bids
“how d’ye do” to pretence.</p>

<p>There are polished marble pillars in this new
church of Beer, where there should be rough-axed
masonry, and a suburban high finish in place of
a rustic rudeness; and the sole relics of what
had once been are the two memorial tablets, themselves
sufficiently rural. One is to “John, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
fifth sonn of William Starr of Bere, Gent., and
Dorothy his wife, which died in the plauge was
here Bvried 1646.” John Starr was one of a
family which, about a century earlier, had become
owners of a moiety of the manor. The house
he built in Beer street bears on one chimney the
initials “J. S.” and on another a star, in punning
allusion to his name.</p>

<p>The other memorial in the church is to
“Edward Good, late an Industrious fisherman,
who left to the Vicar and Churchwardens for the
time being and their successors for ever <span class="smcapuc">TWENTY
POUNDS</span> in <span class="smcapuc">TRUST</span> for the Poor of this Parish.
The interest to be Distributed at Christmas in
the proportion of two thirds at <span class="smcap">Beer</span> and one at
<span class="smcap">Seaton</span>. He died November 7, 1804, in sixty-seventh
year of his Age.”</p>

<p>Of the four industries of Beer—stone-quarrying
smuggling, fishing, and lace-making—the shy
business of smuggling has alone disappeared.
Those who do not carry their explorations beyond
the village street will see nothing of the stone-getting,
for the quarries lie away off the road
between Beer and Branscombe, where, in a cliff-like
scar in the hillside they are still busily being
worked.</p>

<p>It must be close upon two thousand years
since building-stone was first won from this hillside,
for the quarries originated in Roman times.
Since then they have been more or less continually
worked, and although the ancient caves formed
by the old quarrymen in their industry have long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
been abandoned for the open working, they
exist, dark and damp, and not altogether safe
for a stranger, running hundreds of yards in
labyrinthine passages into the earth. It is of
Beer stone that the vaulting and the arches of
the nave in Exeter Cathedral were built, 600
years ago; it was used, even earlier in the crypt of
St. Stephen’s Chapel, Westminster; in Winchester
Cathedral, and many other places; and to-day
is as well appreciated as ever, huge eight and
ten-ton blocks being a feature in the trucks on
the railway sidings down at Seaton. It greatly
resembles Bath stone in its fine texture, but is of
a more creamy colour and, while softer and
more easily worked when newly quarried, dries
harder.</p>

<p>In ancient times the stone was shipped from
the little cove of Beer, which was thus no inconsiderable
place. To improve it, in the words of
Leland: “Ther was begon a fair pere for socour
of shippelettes, but ther cam such a tempest a
three years sins as never in mynd of man had
before bene seene in that shore”; and so the pier
was washed away, and the fragments of it are all
that is to be seen in the unsheltered cove at this
day.</p>

<p>The fishermen of Beer are a swarthy race,
descended, according to tradition, from the crew
of a shipwrecked Spanish vessel, who found the
place almost depopulated by that plague of which
John Starr was a victim. They and their trawlers,
which you see laboriously hauled up on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
beach, are in the jurisdiction of the port of
Exeter.</p>

<p>Here, in the semicircular cove, the summer
sea laps softly among the white pebbles, as
innocently as though it had never drowned a poor
fisherman; and the white of the chalk cliffs, the
equal whiteness of the sea-floor and the clearness
of the water itself give deep glimpses down to
where the seaweed unfurls its banners from rock
and cranny, where the crabs are seen walking
about, hesitatingly, like octogenarians, and jelly-fish
float midway, lumps of transparency, like
marine ghosts. The sea is green here: a light
translucent ghostly green, very beautiful and at
the same time, back of one’s consciousness—if
you examine your feelings—a little mysterious
and repellent, suggesting not merely crabs and
jelly-fish, but inimical unknown things and infinite
perils of the deep, sly, malignant, patiently biding
their time. The green sea has not the bluff
heartiness of the joyous blue.</p>

<p>The little cove, enclosed as it is by steep cliffs,
looks for all the world like a little scene in a little
theatre. You almost expect a chorus of fishermen
to enter and hold forth musically on the delights
of seine-fishing, but they only suggest to the contemplative
stranger that it is “a fine day for a
row,” and ask, in their rich Devonian tones, if
you want a “bwoat.”</p>

<p>The white cliffs of Beer are crannied with
honeycombings and fissures, banded with black
flints, and here and there patterned with ochreous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
pockets of earth, where the wild flowers grow as
though Dame Nature had been making the
workaday place gay with bedding-out plants for
the delight of the summer visitors. The visitors
are just that second string to their old one-stringed
bow of fishing the deep blue sea, which the fishermen
sorely need to carry them through the
twelve months that—although most things that
existed in the nineteenth century have been
changed—still make a year; and the visitors who
are taken out boating beyond the cove to see the
smugglers’ caves are never tired of hearing of
Jack Rattenbury, whose tale I have already told.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">BRANSCOMBE</span></h2>

<p>It is, of course, up-hill out of Beer. One has
not been long, or far, in Devonshire before recognising
that almost immutable law of the
West, by which you descend steeply into every
town or village and climb laboriously out. Here
it is Beer Head to which you ascend. Beer Head
is white, so exceptionally and isolatedly white on
this red coast that when, far westward, down
Teignmouth and Brixham way, you look back and
see along the vaguely defined shore a misty
whiteness, you will know it for none other than
this headland.</p>

<p>Beyond it and its chalky spires and pinnacles
the coast becomes a mere traveller’s bag of
samples for awhile; finally, coming to the opening
of Branscombe, deciding upon “a good line”
of red sandstone, mixed with red marl.</p>

<p>A very serious drawback incidental to the
exploration of districts that grow increasingly
beautiful as you proceed is that all the available
stock of admiratory adjectives is likely to be
expended long before the journey’s end. They
must be carefully husbanded, or you come at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to a nonplus. Therefore, please at this point to
assume beauties that—in the Early Victorian
phrasing—can be “more easily imagined than
described.” For the rest, conceive a wedge-like
opening in the cliffs, cleft to permit the egress
to the sea of a little stream, at all times too tiny
for such a magnificent portal, and often in summer
altogether dried up. On the western side plant
a coastguard station, built like a fort and walled
like a defensive stockade; and there you have
the seaward aspect of Branscombe.</p>

<p>The landward look of it is entirely different.
Looking from the sea, and walking away from it,
three valleys converging seaward are discovered;
each one profound, each richly wooded and fertile,
and in each little instalments of Branscombe
village, dropped casually, as it were, here and
there. I had at first assumed the name “Branscombe”
(which is pronounced with a broad “a,”
like “ar”) to be derived in part from the British
<i>brân</i>, a crow, and “Crowcombe” it might well
be; but it seems, by the dedication of the church
to SS. Winifred and Bradwalladr, that it is really
St. Brannoc’s Combe, for “Brannoc” is an
alias of Bradwalladr.</p>

<p>Away up the valley road are little groups of
the quaintest cottages, with tiny strips of gardens
scarce more than two feet wide, forming, as it
were, a fringe or hem to the walls, and merging
directly, without fence, into the roadway. But
no gardens anywhere can show greater fertility
or a more pleasing variety of flowers. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
them are to be seen spoils of the neighbouring
cliffs, in the shape of petrified vegetation from the
coast between Branscombe and Weston Mouth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus10">
<img src="images/illus10.jpg" width="400" height="325" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BRANSCOMBE.</p>
</div>

<p>Where the roadway climbs round the most
impressive bend, and the great wooded hills look
down on the other side of the valley, with almost
equidistant notches in their skyline, like the
embrasures of cyclopean fortifications, stands the
ancient church of Branscombe. It is oddly placed,
considerably below the level of the road, and is
so old and rugged, and has been so long untouched,
that it looks more like some silver-grey and
lichened rocky outcrop, rudely fashioned in the
form of a church, than the work of builder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
architect. And it is in such entire accord with
the rocks and trees, the ferns and grasses, the
spouting rivulets and moist skies of this secluded
valley, that the dedication of it should more
appropriately be to the sylvan gods of the classic
age. There have been those scribbling tourists
who, passing by and looking upon the time-worn
building, have acted the part of <i>agent provocateur</i>
to “restoring” zealots by dwelling upon the
dampness of it, and the “meanness” of the box-like
deal pews of the interior; but not yet have
their instigations to crime against the picturesque
been acted upon, and the ferns and mosses still
sprout from the time-worn tower and the interior
is still, in its whitewash, its pews, and its wooden
pulpit, an example of the simple sway of the
churchwarden and the village carpenter of a simpler
age.</p>

<p>One highly elaborate monument redeems the
church from a charge of emptiness. It is the
interesting memorial of Joan Tregarthin, her
husbands, John Kellaway and John Wadham,
and her twenty children; all of them duly
sculptured in effigy. The Wadhams were the
great landowners of Branscombe, away back to
the fourteenth century. Among those twenty
children is Nicholas Wadham, the last of his race,
who died in 1609, and with his wife Dorothy
founded Wadham College, Oxford.</p>

<p>The churchyard of Branscombe is a well-stored
repository of unusual epitaphs, ranging from the
sentimental to the unconsciously humorous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the terrifying. Of the last sort the following is
a good example:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Stay, passenger, a while and read</div>
<div class="verse">Your doome I am</div>
<div class="verse">You must bee dead.”</div>

<p>There is fine, rough walking up over the cliffs
past the coastguard station of Branscombe, or
down by the sandy shingle to Littlecombe Shoot
and Weston Mouth, where the landsprings well
out of the marly cliff-sides and petrify everything
within reach. At the cost of scaling some of the
buttery slides of red mud, and becoming more or
less smothered with an ochreous mess resembling
anchovy paste, it is possible to find most interesting
examples of petrified moss and blackberry
brambles; but the weaker brethren and those
“righteous men” (as defined by Mrs. Poyser),
who are “keerful of their clothes,” purchase such
specimens as they may at Branscombe, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
their return home, yarn about the Alpine
difficulties of discovering them.</p>

<p>On the summit to the western side of Weston
Mouth, away back from the beetling edge of
Dunscombe Cliff, 350 feet above the sea, stands
the picturesque group of Dunscombe Farm and
the ruined, ivy-mantled walls of what seems to
have been an old manor-house. To this succeeds
the valley of Salcombe, with the village of Salcombe
Regis, away a mile inland.</p>

<p>It is a long, long way into Sidmouth, through
Salcombe Regis, whose “Regis” was added so
long ago as the time of Athelstan, who owned
the manor and the salt-pans down in the combe
by the sea. When you have come to the houses
and think this is Sidmouth, it is only Landpart,
and there is very near another mile to go; which,
if you have acquired what the Devon people call
a “kibbed”—that is to say a rubbed—heel by
dint of much walking, is a distressing thing.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">SIDMOUTH</span></h2>

<p>Coming into Sidmouth, you see at once that you
are arrived in a Superior Place, and, before you
are perceived, make haste to brush the dust off
your boots, put your headgear straight, and, in
general making yourself look as respectable as
may be possible to a rambler in the byways, step
forth with a jaunty air; just as the postboys in
the old days, driving my lord home, although
their horses might be exhausted, always “kept
a gallop for the avenue.”</p>

<p>Sidmouth was the first of Devonshire seaside
resorts, and had arrived at that condition long
before Thackeray wrote of it as “Baymouth,” in
<i>Pendennis</i>. Do you remember how “Pen flung
stones into the sea, but it still kept coming on”?
It seems hardly worth while to have said as much,
but having been said, let it be put on record that
it has lost none of its ancient courage in the
meanwhile, and in spite of every intimidation,
will still “come on” if you follow Pen’s example;
unless, indeed, you choose the ebb, when, strange
to say, it will retreat. It is believed that this
odd phenomenon has been observed elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Before Torquay, Teignmouth, Exmouth, and
other places had begun to develop, Sidmouth
was a place of fashion, and the signs of that early
favour are still abundantly evident in the town,
which is largely a place of those prim-frontaged,
white-faced houses we associate with the early
years of the nineteenth century. It belongs, in
fact, to the next period following that of Lyme
Regis, and has just reached the point of being
very quaint and old-world and interesting, as
we and ours will have become in the course of
another century. The stucco of Sidmouth is not
as the plaster of Torquay, any more than that of
Park Lane is like the plaster of Notting Hill.
It is of the more suave, kid-glove texture we associate
with Park Lane, is white-painted, and is
only a distant cousin of the later plaster of Notting
Hill and Torquay, which is grey, and painted in
wholly immoral shades of drab and dun, green,
pink, and red; in anything, indeed, but the
virginal white of Sidmouth.</p>

<p>And now, in this town which ought to be
jealously preserved as a precious specimen of
what the watering place of close upon a century
ago was like, the restless evidences of our own
time are becoming plentiful; older houses giving
way to new, of the pretentious character so well
suited to the age, and in red brick and terra-cotta;
the inevitable architectural reach-me-downs that
have obtained ever since Bedford Park set the
vogue.</p>

<p>Why, confound the purblind, batlike stupidity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of it! red brick is not wanted at Sidmouth, where
the cliffs are the very reddest of all Devon. We
need not give the old builders of white-faced
Sidmouth any credit for artistic perceptions,
for they could not choose but build in the fashion
of their age, and everywhere alike, after our own
use and wont; but, by chance, they did exactly
the right thing here, and in midst of this richest
red of the cliffs, this emerald green of the exquisite
foliage, this yellow of the beach, deep blue of the
sea, and cerulean blue above, planted their
terraces and isolated squares of cool, contrasting
whiteness. It was a white period, if you come
to consider it, a time of book-muslin and simplicity,
both natural and affected, and although Sidmouth
was fashionable it was not flamboyant.</p>

<p>To this place, for health and quiet, on account
of their embarrassed finances, and for the sake of
their infant daughter, the Princess Victoria, then
only a few months old, the Duke and Duchess of
Kent came in the autumn of 1819, and took up
their residence at the pretty cottage in Woolacombe
Glen, still standing at the western extremity of
the town. Here, quite unexpectedly, for he was a
robust man, and but fifty-three years of age, the
Duke died, January 23rd, 1820, from inflammation
of the lungs, the result of a chill. Croker wrote of
the event: “You will be surprised at the Duke of
Kent’s death. He was the strongest of the strong.
Never before ill in all his life, and now to die
of a cold when half the kingdom have colds with
impunity. It was very bad luck indeed. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
reminds me of Æsop’s fable of the oak and the
reed.”</p>

<p>Sidmouth continued to grow in favour for
years afterwards, and only began to experience
neglect when the opening of the railways to the
West discovered other beautiful spots in Devonshire.
Next to the Royal association already
recounted, Sidmouth most prides itself on the fact
that in 1831 the Grand Duchess Helene of Russia
for three months resided at Fortfield Terrace.
Without recourse to a book of reference I do not
quite know who exactly was this Grand Duchess,
and am not so impressed as I doubtless ought to
be. Nor do I think any one else is impressed;
but the local historian will never forget the circumstance,
and indeed it is devoutly kept in remembrance
by the black effigy of a double-headed
eagle on the frontage of the terrace.</p>

<p>The railway that took away the prosperity of
Sidmouth is now instrumental in keeping it prosperously
select, for it is something of a business
to arrive in Sidmouth by train, and a great
deterrent to trippers to have to change at Sidmouth
Junction and, journeying by a branch line, to be
deposited on the platform of Sidmouth station,
one mile from the town.</p>

<p>Sidmouth is in these days recovering something
of its own. Not perhaps precisely in the same
way, for the days of early nineteenth-century
aristocratic fashion can never again be repeated
on this earth. But a new vogue has come to it,
and it is as exclusive in its new way as it was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the old; if not, indeed, more exclusive. More
exclusive, more moneyed, not at all well-born,
jewelled up to the eyes, and only wanting the
final touch of being ringed through the nose.
Oddly enough, it is a world quite apart from the
little town; hidden from it, for the most part, in
the hotels of the place. Most gorgeous and
expensive hotels, standing in extensive grounds
of their own, and all linked together in a business
amalgamation, with the object of keeping up
prices and shutting out competition.</p>

<p>It is not easy to see for what purpose the
patrons of these places come to Sidmouth, unless
to come down to breakfast dressed as though one
were going to a ball, and dressing thrice a day
and sitting in the grounds all day long be objects
sufficient. From this point of view, Sidmouth
town is a kind of <i>dependence</i> to the hotels, an
accidental, little known, unessential hem or fringe,
where one cannot wear ball-dresses and tiaras
without exciting unpleasant criticism.</p>

<p>Bullion without birth, money without manners
are in process of revolutionising some aspects of
Sidmouth, and it is quite in accord with the general
trend of things that the newest, the largest, the
reddest, and the most insistent of the hotels should
have shoved a great hulking shoulder up against
the pretty, rambling, white-faced cottage in
Woolacombe Glen, where some earliest infant
months of Queen Victoria were passed, and that
it should have exploited the association by calling
itself the “Victoria.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no river mouth at all at Sidmouth,
and the Sid, which so plentifully christens places
on its banks, has not water enough to force its
way to sea, as a river should. Instead, it abjectly
crawls through the pebbles of the beach, as though
wishful of escaping observation; but when storms
heap up sand and shingle and the Sid is denied
even this humble outlet, then it becomes an urgent
matter to hire labour for the speedy digging out
a passage, lest the low-lying town should be
flooded.</p>

<p class="caption">WOOLACOMBE GLEN.</p>
</div>

<p>The sea-front of Sidmouth is, indeed, yet an
unsolved problem. Many centuries ago, there
seems to have been a harbour where the beach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and the walk of the Esplanade now stand, the
constant easterly drift of shingle being kept well
out to sea by a cliff projecting from the Western
end of the town, where its last remains, the Chit
Rock, stood until 1824. But that protecting
headland was gradually worn away and by sure
degrees the river mouth was choked with shingle.
It is much the same story as that which belongs
to the Axe and to other rivers and obliterated
harbours of South Devon.</p>

<p>Many projects have from time to time been
set afoot to remedy this state of affairs, but without
success. A plan to excavate the river mouth
and form a harbour was mooted in 1811, and
another in 1825. Again, in 1836, an attempt was
made to construct a harbour pier on the site of
the Chit Rock, but was soon abandoned. Even
the more modest attempt made in 1876, to build
a pier on either side of the river mouth—or rather,
where the river mouth should be—failed; and it
seems as though what was long ago written of
Sidmouth will long continue to be true of it:
“In times past a port of some account, now
choaked with chisel and sands by the vicissitudes
of the tides.”</p>

<p>At present, Sidmouth beach is open and
exposed, like that of Seaton, but even when Turner
made his drawing for the projected work on the
“Harbours of England,” although there was
certainly nothing even remotely like a harbour
here, the Chit Rock remained, to afford some
slight protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Chit Rock itself has disappeared. It
vanished in that terrible November storm of 1824,
of whose traces there seems to be no end on the
southern coasts. With the rock went a number
of cottages, and with the cottages almost went
the inhabitants, among them the real original
Dame Partington, who was rash enough to
attempt to mop up the waves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus12">
<img src="images/illus12.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“THE OLD CHANCEL.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Partington might never have attained
immortality, had it not been for Sydney Smith,
who in 1831 compared the House of Lords, rejecting
the Reform Bill, with her. Reform, he said,
<i>would</i> come. The Lords were like Dame Partington
at Sidmouth, who attempted to keep out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Atlantic with a mop, and failed. “She was
excellent at a slop or puddle, but should never
have meddled with a tempest.”</p>

<p>The old parish church was rebuilt, except the
tower, in 1859. It was a rather wanton work,
and to some minds the purely secular use made of
a portion of its stones may be shocking. Those
of the most sacred part of the building, the
chancel, were sold and used in the erection of a
singular-looking villa close at hand, named from
this circumstance, “The Old Chancel.”</p>

<p>There can be few more charming nooks than
that of Woolacombe Glen, where the cottage of
Princess Victoria’s early infancy still stands; a
white-fronted, long, low, rambling building set
in midst of the most cool and delightful lawns
and overhung by trees. But, charming though
it be, the Glen is not what it was at that time,
for the broad road leading down to the Esplanade
is a modern innovation constructed on the site of
other lawns, through which a little stream flowed
to the sea. Alas! for that clear-running Woolabrook.
It has been compelled into an underground
pipe. And—a last little irritating pin-prick—the
“Woolacombe” in the name of the glen is now
shorn of the peculiarly Devonian connecting and
softening <i>a</i> between the syllables, and has become
merely “Woolcombe.” How horrid the deed,
and how excruciating the thought that, if the same
amputating process were extended throughout
the county, we should exchange Babbacombe for
“Babbcombe,” Lannacombe for “Lanncombe,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Ellacombe for “Ellcombe,” and the less lovely
like of them!</p>

<p>High Peak, the tremendous hill and cliff that
shuts in Sidmouth on the west, is well named.
The road up to the top of it is a mile of exhausting
gradients, with fortunately a little grassy ledge
on the way, whence you look down on to a distant
beach and along the pebbly coast to Ladram
Bay and Otterton Point. Ladram Bay is reached
either by cliff-top or along that tiring beach; or,
greatly to be recommended above all other
courses, by boat from Sidmouth, one of whose
boatmen, with the pachydermatous hands that
would scarce feel any effect from rowing fifty
miles, will take you there if you give him a chance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus13">
<img src="images/illus13.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LADRAM BAY.</p>
</div>

<p>Ladram Bay was undoubtedly made expressly
for picnics. There cannot be the least question
of it. Geologists write profound things about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the raised beach and the pebbles—Triassic, Silurian,
or what not jargon—that compose it, but
Nature most certainly in prophetic mood designed
beach, natural arch, and caves for lunch and
laughter, and as a romantic background for
flirtations.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">OTTERTON—EAST BUDLEIGH—SIR WALTER
RALEIGH</span></h2>

<p>At the summit of High Peak is the common of
Muttersmoor, whence the way goes steeply down
into the valley of the River Otter, at length
reaching the village of Otterton, down the sides
of whose one quaint street, of a rustic, straw-littered,
farm-like untidiness, flow streamlets
bridged by little brick and timber spans.</p>

<p>Otterton is thoroughly Devonian. What it
is to be so will, perhaps, not be understood by
those unfamiliar with rustic Devon; but here is
the recipe for such a characteristic place. Take
an Irish, a Welsh, a Highland, and a Breton
village, stir them up well in a fine, confused
Celtic medley, add abundance of flowers, wild
and cultivated, and then leave in the sun.</p>

<p>On a rise, above the river and the village street,
stands the “fayre howse” built by Richard
Duke, who in 1539 bought the Otterton property
of Sion Abbey, and set up for lord of the manor.
His shield-of-arms, sculptured over the door, is
still visible, but his fair house has come down in
the world, and the line of Duke of Otterton ended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in 1775, when the Rolles acquired their belongings.
The traveller in South East Devon very soon has
a surfeit of Rolles, who seem to be pervading the
land and rebuilding the interesting churches, and
generally occulting everything. Here again the
old church has been replaced by a new.</p>

<p>Below church and manor-house runs the lovely
Otter to the sea. The Otter is twin brother to
the Axe, and the Exe is the big brother of both.
The strath—that is to say the verdant, low-lying
meadowland—of the Otter is of that quiet,
wooded, pastoral beauty which makes the nearness
of the sea seem strange. But the speciality of
the Otter seems to be its pebbles, or “popples,”
as the name is, locally. There are more pebbles
on the Chesil Beach; but then, that is one of the
two greatest repositories for them in the world,
and the popples of the Otter and of the seashore
at Budleigh Salterton, where they are not only
numerous, but very fine and large as well, are a
class to themselves. Little beaches of them
skirt the course of the river, and the matter of two
and a half miles up-stream from Otterton is a
village, as one may say, dedicated to them, in
its name of Newton Poppleford; and there the
popples muster as strongly as ever by the ford,
which is now superseded by a bridge.</p>

<p>But now, crossing the Otter, we come to East
Budleigh, by threading the mazes of two or three
byways.</p>

<p>East Budleigh is a pretty village, with a little
stream, clear-running, down one side of its street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and a great church on the rise at the end; but,
for all that, I should not have come out of the way
to see it, were it not that a landmark of more
than common interest lies half a mile on the other
side. That landmark is Hayes Barton, the still
extant farmstead that was the birthplace of Sir
Walter Raleigh.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus14">
<img src="images/illus14.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption">EAST BUDLEIGH.</p>
</div>

<p>The first part of the name of Hayes Barton
derives from the Anglo-Saxon <i>haga</i>, a hedge, or
cultivated enclosure from surrounding wastes,
and there are, to this day, “hayes,” and “hays,”
in abundance in this shire of Devon. Even in
the urban circumstances of Exeter we find them,
in the enclosed public pleasure-ground of Northernhay,
and the square of Southernhay. “Barton”
has a variety of meanings, from granary, rickyard,
farmyard, and cattle-shed, to a large farm; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
small farm being generally, in Devon, styled a
“living.” In the time of Sir Walter Raleigh’s
father, Hayes Barton was sold to the Duke family,
of Otterton, and from its old name of Poerhayes,
or Power’s Heys, it became known as Dukesheyes.
In the eighteenth century, as we have already
seen, it passed to the Rolles, whose paws have
comprehended so much of the land between
Seaton and Exmouth.</p>

<p>The old farm-house, smartened up with a
facing of that stucco which is so beloved by
Devon folk that it is almost a wonder they don’t
make it an article of diet, stands now as ever in
a hollow of the hills, remote; for although
Budleigh Salterton has expanded into a townlet,
I do not suppose the village of East Budleigh has
grown appreciably in all these centuries. Bating
that stucco, and the sixty-year-old brick outhouses,
the farm must be much the same, and you may
still see the old woodwork and the old stone flags
of the lower rooms, and may even, by courtesy,
peep into the bedroom—that is the window of
it, the upper window in the left-hand gable—where
that gallant soul first saw the light of
day.</p>

<p>Here, in this modest farmstead, that great
Elizabethan was born, in 1552, son of Walter
Raleigh and his wife Katherine, who came of
that old Devon family, the Champernownes of
Modbury. She had first married Otto Gilbert,
who died leaving her with two sons, themselves
to grow up explorers and colonists. She would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
seem, therefore, to have been a woman of remarkable
character.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus15">
<img src="images/illus15.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption">HAYES BARTON: BIRTHPLACE OF SIR WALTER RALEIGH.</p>
</div>

<p>The Raleighs seem to have been gentlefolk
of long descent, of many relationships among the
storied names of Devon—the Carews, the Grenvilles,
Gilberts, and others—but of only modest
worldly possessions. The Raleigh genealogy is
fragmentary, and the early history of the family
vague, but that they had once been locally rich
and powerful, before the famous Sir Walter’s
day, seems evident enough in the names of the
two neighbouring parishes of Withycombe Raleigh
and Colaton Raleigh, which show that in
more prosperous times his forbears had been
lords of those manors. In common with many
of their contemporaries, the Raleighs seem to
have spelt their name according to individual
taste and fancy; nor even did the same individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
always select, and adhere to, one method. Thus
we find the father of the greatest of all Raleighs
signing himself “Ralegh,” his eldest son, Carew,
affecting “Rawlegh,” and the future Sir Walter,
in his first known signature, writing “Rauleygh,”
and afterwards adopting “Ralegh,” and the form
“Raleigh,” which posterity has finally decided
to accept. Queen Elizabeth herself spelled the
name “Rawley.”</p>

<p>Sentimentalists have united to draw a wholly
imaginary picture of the boy, Walter Raleigh,
ranging from the inland valley in which his
birthplace stands, climbing the intermediate woody
hill, and straying down to the margin of the sea
at Budleigh Saltern, as Budleigh Salterton was
then styled. They have drawn fanciful pictures
of him among the amazing pebbles of that beach,
listening wide-eyed, to the yarns of sailor-folk
telling of strange histories from the Spanish Main;
and they have pictured him exploring away down
to Exmouth, which was in those times a port of
considerable commerce. I have no doubt he
did all these things, and for my part can readily
envisage them; can see, too, the little, crisp-haired,
ruddy-cheeked Walter, in russet doublet
and stockings of the same, being taken to church
on Sundays at East Budleigh, half a mile away,
where you may still see the family pew with the
heraldic “fusils” of Raleigh impaling the “rests”
of Grenville, boldly sculptured in heart of oak
on a massive bench-end.</p>

<p>But while we can picture all these things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
with sufficient readiness, it yet remains certain
that we know nothing of the hero’s earlier years,
and but vaguely gather that from Oxford, whither
he was sent, he went to the wars on the
Continent, between the Protestants and the
Catholics, and then, by some occult family influence,
became attached to the brilliant Court
of our own astounding virginal Gloriana. They
were a coruscating Renaissance group, who circled
round Elizabeth, and were gifted in a singular
variety of ways. They were noblemen and gentlemen
who could, and did, turn their hands to
anything, from captaining some desperate enterprise,
negotiating treaties, steering frail flotillas
through unknown seas into unheard-of lands,
buccaneering, and filibustering, down to duelling,
intriguing and backbiting among each other;
practising literature and the liberal art of sonneteering,
and dallying in the dangerous pastime
of flirting with that too towardly Queen herself.
One thing only they could not do; they could
not be commonplace. None may say how much
of truth, or how much legend there may be in
the famous story of how Raleigh first attracted
the Queen’s notice by flinging down his velvet
cloak over a muddy place, so that she might
pass, clean-footed; but the story was current, in
the time of those contemporary with both, and
being possible at all, shows us the spirit of the time
and of the Queen’s surroundings.</p>

<p>Raleigh’s excellent early services in Ireland,
where he broke down the rebellion in the south,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
recommended him to the Queen, his youthfulness
interested her middle-aged sentimentalism, and
his dark, florid manhood enslaved her. For this
was a very hero in look, as in deed; standing six
feet high, with black hair, full-bearded, ruddy-cheeked,
like the apples of his native shire; and
Elizabeth loaded him with gifts and grants.
Meanwhile he had begun the colonising schemes
and the exploratory enterprises by which his
name is largely known. He equipped, and was
at the cost of, the expedition which in 1584
discovered that shore of North America he
christened, in honour of the “Eternal Maiden
Queen,” “Virginia.” At the close of that year
a knighthood rewarded his flattery.</p>

<p>Already he was become a man of vast wealth,
the holder of highly remunerative grants and
monopolies, and was keenly desirous of refounding
the house of Raleigh in visible form in Devon.
To this end he wrote in July, 1584, to Mr. Duke
of Otterton, into whose possession this farm of
Hayes Barton had by some unexplained means
come, desiring to repurchase it. The letter is
still in existence, and runs:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Duke</span>,</p>

<p>“I wrote to Mr. Prideux to move yow
for the purchase of hayes a farme som tyme
in my fathers prossession. I will most willingly
give yow what so: ever in your conscience
yow shall deeme it worthe, and if

<p class="center">“in all I shall be able”</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">W. Ralegh</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is surely no unamiable trait in a man, that
he should wish to purchase the house in which he
was born; but Mr. Duke, “from that jealous
disposition which can bear no brother near the
throne,” did not choose to sell or to have so great
a man for so near a neighbour, and so the Raleighs
never again entered into possession of Hayes
Barton.</p>

<span class="smaller">BUDLEIGH SALTERTON—LITTLEHAM—EXMOUTH—TOPSHAM—ESTUARY
OF THE AXE</span></h2>

<p>Budleigh Salterton lies at the foot of a steep
descent. Only within quite recent years has it
been connected by railway with the outer world,
and so has not yet quite woke up and found itself,
and become self-conscious; although there are
plenteous evidences that attempts will be made
to convert it into a small modern watering-place,
pitifully emulative of its betters. It is not fulsome
to say that up to the present it has had no
betters, for it has been an individual place, without
its fellow anywhere. Conceive a brook running in
a deep bed down one side of a village street, and
bridged at close upon half a hundred intervals with
brick and plank footbridges, leading across into
cottages and cottage-gardens; and conceive those
cottages, partly the humble homes of fishermen,
and partly the simple villas of an Early Victorian,
or even a Regency, seaside, and midway down the
street imagine that stream crossing under the
road, taking the little beach diagonally, and there
percolating through the giant “popples.” That
is Budleigh Salterton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The Otter flows out to sea farther to the east,
along that beach, obscurely, but still one speculates
idly—no help for it but to do <i>anything</i> “idly”
in South Devon—by what strange and exceptional
chance Budleigh Salterton is not “Ottermouth”
in this county of Axmouth, Sidmouth, Exmouth,
Teignmouth, and other places which own rivers as
their godfathers and godmothers. Yet one is
not too idle to discover that East Budleigh and
this Budleigh “Saltern,” as it was originally
named, <i>do</i>, after all, in a way, follow the general
rule, for they are named after the contributory
streamlet, the Buddle, on which they stand and
the “leas,” or meadows, that border it.</p>

<p>It is the same old story, with regard to the
haven at the mouth of the Otter, that has already
been told of other places. Leland, writing close
upon four hundred years ago, tells us that: “Less
than an hunderith yeres sins shippes usid this
haven, but it is now clean barred,” and so it remains.
Salterton and its neighbourhood are therefore
without the convenience of a port.</p>

<p>The front of the townlet is, as an Irishman
might say, at the back, for in times before the invention
of the seaside as a place of holiday, the
inhabitants seem to have had a surfeit of the sea
by which they got their living, and built their
houses on the low crumbly cliff, not only with
the faces turned away from it, but in many cases
with high dead walls, enclosing back-gardens,
entirely excluding any sight of the water. And
so the “front” remains; nor is it clear how,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
without a wholesale rebuilding, it will ever be
otherwise. It is a curious spot for a seaside resort,
and in places more resembles an allotment-garden,
or the side of one of those railway embankments,
where frugal porters and platelayers cultivate
vegetables; for between the pathway and the sea,
on the fringe of that beach where the gigantic
popples lie, ranging in size from a soup-plate down
to a saucer, and forming the raw material of the
local paving, there are rows of potatoes, cabbages,
peas, and scarlet runners! The effect is a good
deal more funny than the humour of a professional
humourist, for it has that essential ingredient of
real humour, unexpectedness; and he who does
not laugh at first sight of the peas among those
amazing popples, and the boats amid the beans,
must be a dull dog.</p>

<p>The explorer who does not wish to martyr
himself on the way from Salterton to Exmouth
may be recommended to take steamer, for it is
six miles of anti-climax by shore and cliff, and
four by uninteresting hard high road, passing the
wickednesses of suburban expansion at Littleham,
in whose churchyard is the neglected grave of
Frances, Viscountess Nelson, who died in 1831,
the deeply wronged wife of the naval hero.</p>

<p>A marble monument to her in the church does,
however, make some amends for the neglect outside.
There, in that interior, are memorials to Peels,
relatives of the statesman, and others to those
ubiquitous Drakes who, like the Courtenays and
recurring decimals, repeat themselves indefinitely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving Littleham behind, there presently
begins the long-drawn approach to Exmouth
itself, looking as though all Ladbroke Grove and
Putney Hill had moved down, <i>en bloc</i>, for a sea-change.
And, oh, how blue and refreshing and
lovely looks that peep of the sea over towards
Dawlish that you get at the end of this long,
hot and dry perspective!</p>

<p>And as you think thus, you remember the
pungent saying of Dr. Temple, who once, while still
Bishop of Exeter, stood upon the steps of the
vicarage of Exmouth and remarked that “Exmouth
was a good place to look—from.”</p>

<p>He was absolutely correct, for Exmouth,
facing directly into the west, is especially famed
for its sunsets. To peruse the local guide-books
one might even think Exmouth had entered into
arrangements with the solar system for a supply
of the best displays.</p>

<p>But there was, as you have already suspected,
a sting behind the bishop’s remark. What a
waspishness beyond the ordinary these high-placed
clerics do develop! The beauties of Exmouth
are external, extrinsic, a minus quantity;
but it is placed in the loveliest situation at the
seaward end of the long and beautiful estuary
of the Exe. The beauty of the views across sea
and river are unspeakable. To me it is an Avalon,
a Gilead, where the balm is; a country in the
likeness of the Land of the Blest, you see over
there, where the red cliffs dip down in fantastic
shapes to the sea, and where the heights of Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Haldon and Mamhead, clothed with clumps of
trees of a richness only Devon can show, rise to
the glowing sky. I yearn ever to be over yonder
in that Land of Heart’s Desire, as the good Christian
should yearn for Paradise; and the little hamlets
dwarfed by the two miles of water, and even the
little trains that seem to go so slowly, trailing
their long trails of steam, are things of poetry
and romance.</p>

<p>If I were to say that Exmouth was the Margate
of Devonshire, I should please neither Exmouth
nor Margate; for all Devon does not contain a
purely seaside resort of the size of that favourite
place in Kent. But it is, like Margate, popular
with trippers; it has sands; and is, in short a
place where the crowd spends a happy day: the
crowd in this instance hailing, as a rule, from
no further than Exeter.</p>

<p>Exeter is an interesting city, and its citizens,
in their own streets and in their everyday garb
are sufficiently amiable, but when Exmouth on
Sundays and other holiday-times is overrun with
Exeter’s young men, tradesmen’s assistants, clad
in the impossible clothes pictured on provincial
advertisement hoardings, laughing horse-laughs,
singing London’s last season’s comic songs, wearing
flashy jewellery, and smoking bad cigars, Exeter’s
reputation, and Exmouth’s suffer alike. If you
can imagine such a curious hybrid as a provincial
cockney—the type really exists, although it has
not yet been noticed by men of science—you may
picture something of Exmouth’s week-end patrons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
The provincial cockney, poor thing, imagines
himself in the forefront of style, but he is merely
a caricature of the London cockney plus his own
accent, which, wedded to cockney slang, is peculiarly
offensive.</p>

<p>But Exmouth, when its week-end patrons are
behind their counters, in their aprons, is a vastly-different
place. It is cheap, and has always
been, and always will be, but it is at last sloughing
off that air of impending bankruptcy that once sat
so dolefully upon the scene; and the shops that
were once mere apologies are now for the most
part real shops, and stocked with articles less than
ten years old. Moreover, the tennis lawns and
gardens have grown by lapse of time into things
of beauty: the lawns becoming something else
than bald patches of red earth, and the gardens
luxuriant indeed. But cheap railway trips from
Exeter, only ten miles distant, by South Western
Railway, have determined the character of Exmouth
for ever, and grey stucco, only on the outskirts
occasionally varied with red brick, or
rough-cast, has clothed it in a sad shabbiness
until its ninety-nine years building-leases shall
have lapsed.</p>

<p>Modern times, however, are making themselves
felt in other directions. In early days, when the
town of Exmouth was merely a longshore settlement
called “Pratteshythe,” situated where the
docks now are, the mouth of the river was largely
obstructed by an immense sandbank stretching
from this shore. At some unnamed period this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
geographical feature of the place changed sides,
and has for centuries past been that delightfully
wild, nearly two-miles long wilderness, “the
Warren,” which extends a sandy arm from
Langston Cliff; leaving something less than
half-a-mile of fairway at the mouth of Exe.
Until quite recently the Warren has remained
the haunt of the wild-fowler and the naturalist,
but now the red roofs of bungalows are beginning
to plentifully dot the wastes; and to play at
Robinson Crusoe, with twentieth-century embellishments
and more or less luxurious fringes,
has become a favourite summer pastime on this
once solitary haunt of the heron, the wild duck,
and the sea-mew.</p>

<p>The salt estuary of the Exe runs up boldly
from Exmouth, a mile broad, past Lympstone;
and then, suddenly contracting, reaches Topsham,
which was in other days a place of considerable
importance, where ships were built and a great
deal done in the Newfoundland trade; and in
the smuggling trade too. Now the old shipyards
are forgotten, and Topsham, which, among other
things, was formerly the port of Exeter, is merely
a relic, in course of being submerged by Exeter’s
suburbs. Yet still odd nooks may be found,
with that curious alien air belonging to all such
out-of-date seaports, and in shy old houses
Topsham is peculiarly rich in old blue-and-white
Dutch tiles.</p>

<p>Topsham ceased from being a port when the
present Exe Canal was made, in 1827, from Turf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
up to the very streets of the city: the first ship
canal that ever was. It is five miles in length,
and thirty feet wide, and it cost £125,000. Anciently,
however, the tide flowed the whole way
to Exeter, until, in the old high-handed mediæval
days, the imperious Isabella de Redvers wrought
her vengeance against the city by causing the
stream to be dammed with felled trees, thus obstructing
the navigation. Doubtless, in their
turn, the citizens damned the countess, so far
as they safely could, but there the obstruction
remained, and thus the still-existing “Countess
Weir” came into being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The enterprising citizens of Exeter cut a small
canal, so early as 1554. This was afterwards
enlarged, and the present undertaking is the still
more enlarged successor of those early waterways.
It is a pleasant and clear canal, with none of those
evil associations the word “canal” generally
implies, and the walk along the broad towing-paths
into Exeter yields one of the most striking
views of that picturesque city.</p>

<span class="smaller">POWDERHAM AND THE COURTENAYS—STARCROSS</span></h2>

<p>But the coast really does not reach to Exeter.
Let us take boat across from the picturesque
waterside of Topsham, and then follow the
western bank of Exe down to the sea. It is by
far the prettier and more rural side, but, perversely
enough, all the eastern shore, including
Lympstone and Exmouth, looks in the distance
exceptionally beautiful; and no one who only
knows the west is content until he has crossed
and explored the east. But it is the better part
to remain so far untravelled, and to keep the
illusion.</p>

<p>The South Western Railway has exploited
the eastern shore of Exe, and the Great Western
runs its main line along the west, and each is
characteristic: the South Western peculiarly
suburban, bustling and commonplace, the Great
Western sweeping on in noble curves, with a
wayside station, at which trains rarely halt,
planted here and there. It skirts the water on
one hand, and Powderham Park, seat of the Earls
of Devon, on the other.</p>

<p>Romance, as well as beauty, belongs to Powderham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
for it has been for over five hundred years
the seat of the Courtenays, a younger branch of
the family which was settled at Courtenay, fifty-six
miles south of Paris, in the ninth century. They
married into the royal family of France, and
three in succession were Emperors of Constantinople
in the last days of Christian rule there.
It seems a proud thing to have numbered emperors
among one’s ancestors, but those imperial
Courtenays of old Byzantium were, it must be
owned, put to many indignities and miserable
shifts, and the imperial purple was more than a
thought moth-eaten. They were reduced to selling
and mortgaging their property, to scouring half
Europe for alms, and in the end the Turks captured
their sorry empire. Then the elder Courtenays
returned to the rank of French nobles, and
although they had an admixture of royal blood,
sank gradually throughout the centuries until
at length they became simple peasants. The last
of them died towards the middle of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>The English Courtenays appear to derive from
Reginald de Courtenay, who relinquished his
French nationality and properties, and in the
reign of Henry the Second came to England. He
acquired honours and manors, and was the ancestor
of Hugh de Courtenay, Baron of Okehampton,
created Earl of Devon as heir in right of his
mother, to the lands and titles of the De Redvers
family, who had previously held the earldom.
Powderham came to the Courtenays with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
second earl, to whom it was brought by his wife,
Margaret, daughter of the Earl of Hereford. He
gave it to his sixth son, Philip, who was the
builder of the castle. Here his descendants,
members of the younger of the branches into
which the English Courtenays spread, have ever
since resided, and might have been merely squires
or knights yet, but for the misfortunes that befell
the members of the elder branch, who in the wars
of rival York and Lancaster took the losing side,
with the result that three brothers in succession,
the sixth, seventh and eighth earls, sealed with
their blood, on scaffold or in stricken field, their
devotion to the Red Rose. With those gallant,
but ill-fated partisans of a just cause the elder
line became extinct, and when the family honours
were revived under the Lancastrian Henry the
Seventh, they went to the next branch in order
of seniority, represented by Sir Edward Courtenay
of Haccombe, the first earl of a new creation.
To him succeeded his grandson, son of Sir William
Courtenay and the Lady Katherine Plantagenet
daughter of Edward the Fourth; second earl,
and later advanced to be Marquis of Exeter.
The fortunes of the Courtenays now seemed to
be again improving, but those were the times of
Henry the Eighth, when quick changes and dramatic
reverses of fortune were the rule. The same
king who had created the earl a marquis later
capriciously sent him to the block, confiscated
his property, and annulled the family honours.
A strange romance sheds a mysterious glamour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
over the story of his son Edward, who is said to
have been loved by Queen Mary and slighted
by him for her sister, Elizabeth. The queen
made him earl of yet another new creation, but
later threw him into prison on an absurd charge
of aiding the rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyatt,
which he had really been largely instrumental in
quelling. It was ill consorting with the Tudors,
or even living in their times, for they were tigerish
alike in their affections and their hatreds. This
ill-used young earl—“this beautiful youth,”
Gibbon calls him—was released, but died mysteriously,
it is supposed of poison—at Padua, in 1556.
With him that branch of the Courtenays, and it
was long supposed the title also, became extinct.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the junior branch, the Courtenays
of Powderham, continued unmolested. “He that
is low need fear no foe,” says the old proverb;
and those plain knights and, later, baronets
excited the jealousy of no one. So they continued
until the era of beheadings and forfeitures ended,
when Sir William Courtenay was created Viscount
Courtenay in 1762. And viscounts they might
be yet, only in 1851 an accomplished genealogist,
looking over the patent of nobility granted by
Queen Mary, discovered the all-important fact
that the usual words “<i>de corpore</i>,” limiting the
title to direct descendants, were not included.
The succession was thus extended to collaterals,
and the curious fact was revealed that for two
hundred and seventy-five years the Courtenays
of Powderham had been earls unknown to themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and had gratefully accepted inferior honours
while legally possessed of greater.</p>

<p>The claim being proved before the House of
Lords, the third viscount in this manner, became
the tenth earl. It was he who, regaining the title,
plunged the Courtenays again into embarrassments
and alienated much of the family property, and
it was Viscount Courtenay, son of the venerable
eleventh earl, who still further wrecked their
fortunes by his losses upon the Turf, which were
partly liquidated during his short tenure of the
title. The thirteenth earl, who died in 1904,
ninety-three years of age, was uncle of the twelfth,
and rector of Powderham. He resided at the
rectory; for, of the 50,000 acres and the yearly
rent-roll of £40,000, mentioned in the New Domesday
Book, only an inconsiderable residue is
left. Gibbon says of the French Courtenays
and their old home: “The Castle of Courtenay
was profaned by a plebeian owner,” and here
we see the strange spectacle of the seat of the
English Courtenays being let to a stranger, and
the titled owner of it, a clergyman, living obscurely
on the fringe of his own encumbered domain.
The reverses of fortune experienced by this
ancient race may well seem to render their old
motto, adopted in the sixteenth century, still
applicable: <i>Ubi lapsus? Quid feci?</i> = “Where
have I fallen? What have I done?” It is, at
any rate, better than their sentiment of later
years: <i>Quod verum tutum</i> = “What is true is
safe.” That is indeed a hard saying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no other family so constantly met with
in Devon. Villages—like Sampford Courtenay—bear
their name: their monuments are in Exeter
Cathedral, and in many a town and village church,
and in the majority of ancient Devon churches
you will at least see their easily distinguished
arms sculptured somewhere—the three golden
torteaux, roundels, or bezants, supposed by some
to have originated in the family association with
the Byzantine crown, or flippantly thought by
others to typify their last three sovereigns.</p>

<p>The old church of Powderham, built of the
rich, red sandstone, stands quite close to the
railway, amid the trees of the noble deer-haunted
park. The railway then, following the shore
along a low sea-wall, comes to the wooden station
of Starcross, through which most of the trains
rush without stopping. From its crazy timber
platforms, standing with their feet in the water,
you look across nearly two miles of salt water to
Exmouth, transfigured by distance; its dreadful
make-believe Gothic church, built in the architectural
dark ages of the opening years of the
nineteenth century, bulking like a cathedral.
A steam launch plies between Starcross and Exmouth
in these days, instead of the row-boat that
once gave such tremendous rowing to get across;
so the sundered shores of Exe are become less
foreign and speculative to one another than they
were of old. But, as the reader will have already
perceived, these increased facilities have destroyed
illusions. Exmouth we have already revealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
for what it is, rather than what it seems, across
the shining water, and Lympstone, yonder, looks
better from Starcross than close at hand:</p>

<p>To those given to grotesque phonetic affinities,
Lympstone suggests cripples; for myself, looking
here across the pale blue and opalesque estuary,
where the seagulls ride the still waters, waiting
for the tide to ebb and the small sprats and the
cockles to become revealed as meals, Lympstone
suggests a limpid stream and refreshing breezes.
There it nestles; a little strand with little houses
and a little church, set down in the opening between
two little cliffs of red, red sandstone; but
when you arrive there Lympstone is modern,
the church has been rebuilt, with the exception
of the tower, and an ornate clock-tower, Jubilee
or other, flaunts it insolently.</p>

<p>Starcross itself has been described as “a
melancholy attempt at a watering-place,”—probably
by some person who regards Exmouth as
a cheerful and successful effort in that direction;
but “There’s no accounting for tastes,” as the old
woman said when she kissed her cow. As sheer
matter of fact, Starcross never attempted anything
in that way, but just—like Topsy—“grew,” and
so became what it is; a large village of one long,
single-sided street, looking once uninterruptedly
upon the shore and the water, but since the railway
came, commanding first-class views of expresses,
locals, and goods-trains; and more or less identified
by strangers with a singular Italianate tall red
tower, sole relic of the atmospheric system with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
which the then South Devon Railway was opened
in 1846. This survival of one of the old engine-houses
completes a conspicuously beautiful view
along the Exe, raised thereby to the likeness of
an Italian lake. The one other remarkable feature
of Starcross is the curious little steamship,
modelled like a swan, that for some fifty or more
years past has been moored off Starcross jetty;
to the huge amazement of travellers coming this
way for the first time.</p>

<p>For the rest, Starcross is merely a more or less
modern development of a very ancient little
fisher hamlet of the inland parish of Kenton, close
upon two miles inland, and is said to have been
originally “Stair-cross”; a crossing, or passage,
to Exmouth. Maps, showing how the road from
Exeter only approaches the coast at this point
and then immediately turns away again, support
this view.</p>

<p>The high road, leaving Starcross, winds around
Cockwood Creek, and passing for a while over
level ground ascends, steep and narrow and between
high banks, past the old-time smugglers’
haunt, “Mount Pleasant Inn,” and so over the
cliff top to Dawlish. Hut the coastwise path by
the Warren, and so over the railway to Langston
Cliff and the sea-wall, is the only way for
beauty. Over the cliffs, by the high road, you come
dispirited into Dawlish, with the latest greedy
proceedings of speculative builders very much
in evidence before the town itself is seen. Such
a manner of approach is highly injurious. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
as though a guest bidden to a country house were
admitted through the back door. One had rather
enter Dawlish by train, for the railway runs along
a sea-wall under the cliffs, and the station is built
on the edge of the sands.</p>

<span class="smaller">DAWLISH—ASHCOMBE—THE PARSON AND CLERK</span></h2>

<p>Dawlish looks its very best from the railway
station; not the least doubt of it, and looks best
of all to passengers bound elsewhere. From the
train you have on one side the blue sea, the red
rocks, the yellow-brown sands; and on the other
the lovely lawns and gardens in midst of the
town, with the little stream called “Dawlish
Water,” tamed and trimmed, and made to tumble
over half a hundred little cascades, in between.
In short, like any tradesman, Dawlish displays
its best goods—nay, more, its entire stock-in-trade—in
the shop window.</p>

<p>The name of Dawlish is rather by way of being
a calamity. Antiquaries declare it derives from
the Celtic <i>dol isc</i>; that is to say, “the meadow
by the water”—and as we have seen, the stream
and the gardens are the chief feature of the place—but
the modern form of the name is fatally attractive
for cheap wits. Even great minds have
declined to the remark that “Dawlish is dawlicious”;
and as the excursion trains in summer
draw up to the platform and strangers step out
from the carriages, to stretch their legs for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
moment before going on, the idiot jape trips off
a hundred tongues.</p>

<p>At Dawlish, however, the traveller first realises
himself fully in the West. The view, the colour,
the speech, all proclaim it.</p>

<p>Ah! the old familiar cries of the West, they
warm the heart with the fires of remembrance.
As the traveller comes down the line, so insensibly
he comes into the districts where the soft slurring
burr of the West of England prevails. You first
notice it, if you are travelling by a stopping train,
at Swindon, on whose platforms the newspapers—in
the speech of the bookstall imps—become “Londun
pay-purr”; and when the train draws up
to the seaside platforms of Dawlish, the shibboleth
has become “Lundee pay.” Long, too, may the
fishwives of Teignmouth continue their rounds,
with their endearing “Any nice fresh whiting
to-day, my dear?” to old and young, gentle or
simple.</p>

<p>There are wild and beautiful valleys away
behind Dawlish; in especial that vale down
whose leafy gullies flows the clear stream of
Dawlish Water, which, rising out of the green
bosom of Great Haldon, up Harcombe way, comes
down by Ashcombe and, reaching Dawlish, is
made to perform quite a number of parlour tricks
before it is allowed to straggle out over the sands
and pebbles of the beach, and find a well-earned
rest in the sea.</p>

<p>There are folk of primitive ways of thought
and rugged speech up the valley of Dawlish Water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and their characteristics are those of old Devon,
of whose peasantry it has been truly said: “They
work hard, live hard, hold hard, and die hard.”</p>

<p>“My tongue has two sides to et, like a bull’s;
a rough an’ a smuthe,” said a sharp-spoken
woman up at Harcombe—or I should say, “up tu
Harcume”—and up tu Ashcombe they talk in
a way that no mortal man coming fresh to Devon
can understand. There is a picturesque rustic
church high up on a knoll in the dwindling village
of Ashcombe, and there is a quaint old smithy
with an equally quaint old couple of bachelor
brothers, the smiths of it, who have the simplicity
of children, the richest brogue in all Devon, and
the unaffected courtesy we associate with great
nobles. “We’m plazed tu zee ’ee, ye knaw, ye
bain’t a stranger tu Ashcume, they tell me”;
while their housekeeper says, “Zittee down,
do ’ee,” and with her apron vigorously dusts a
chair which, like all else in this spotless interior,
is absolutely innocent of dust. It is the rustic
way of showing politeness.</p>

<p>As for their speech, all Devonians have that
characteristic rich twist of the tongue which one
cannot well convey in all its richness in paper
and print, and for “stranger” say “strangurr.”
Similarly, when, during a conversation with them,
an insect of sorts bites you painfully, they inform
you it is a “hoss-stingurr.”</p>

<p class="caption">DAWLISH.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a prized possession at the smithy, in
the shape of an old bureau, which has been in the
family for goodness knows how many generations,
and the visitor will probably be invited to see
the “sacred” drawer they discovered. Here, in
the cold medium of print it is obvious enough that
a “secret” drawer is meant, but I assure you it
is by no means so immediately obvious on the
spot, and you quite expect an introduction to some
holy of holies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Dawlish is shut in on the west by the great cliff
of Lea Mount, which forms, both in colour and
shape, an unforgettable feature.</p>

<p>Lea Mount owes its formal, straight-cut outline
to the anxieties that followed the falling of a
portion of the cliff on August 29th, 1885, when over
fifty tons of rock buried a party of seven women
and children, killing three of them. To prevent
further accidents, all overhanging portions were
cut away.</p>

<p>Through this vivid red mass plunges the main
line of the Great Western Railway, in a series
of five longer or shorter tunnels, emerging through
Parson Tunnel upon the long sea wall that brings
it into Teignmouth. From Dawlish sands the
long and bold range of cliffs ending in Hole Head
and the Parson and Clerk rocks is distinctly seen,
but there has ever been some considerable doubt
as to which of these rocks of Hole Head is the
Clerk. Commonly the solitary wave-washed pillar
standing out to sea has been given the name,
but there are certainly the likenesses of two faces
on the cliff itself, one immediately under the
other; and there have always been those who
have pointed them out as the unworthy pair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>From one of the little coves that notch the
cliffs between Dawlish and Teignmouth, those
giant profiles are seen with advantage. They are
impressive at a distance and even in calm weather,
but near at hand, and when the clouds lower and
the screaming winds tear off the crests of the
waves and dash them in clouds of flying spume
over the hurrying trains, they are not a little
awesome. The Parson, with round, bullet-like
head, looks sternly out, with calm, inscrutable face,
and all the dignity of a colossal Rameses, upon the
whirl of wind and water. The Clerk, beneath
him, a senile, doddering countenance, with wide-open
mouth and thick, pendulous lips, seems to
laugh and gibber maniacally at the racket of the
elements, and is a little dreadful to behold.</p>

<p>There is no way round Hole Head to Teignmouth.
Sheer walls of rock and a stark descent
into the sea forbid; but some day, when local
authorities take the hints that nature and latter-day
circumstances have thrown out, a road will
be made under those cliffs, and the sundered
towns made neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, there are two prime ways of getting
to Teignmouth: the one a threepenny journey
by train from Dawlish station, the loveliest threepenny
railway ride in the kingdom; the other
a shockingly hilly climb up by the high road
that goes over Lea Mount, and so, in a series of
sharp rises and falls brings you, at one mile from
Teignmouth, to a breakneck descent into the
town, usually ending, for cyclists some few years
ago, in a pantomime-trick disappearance through
the window of the “Dawlish Inn” and a removal,
as the case might be, to the hospital or the cemetery.
But more scientific brakes have happily
neutralised these dangers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[87]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">THE PARSON AND CLERK ROCKS.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>There is, however, a delightful variant of this
road journey that cannot too greatly be praised.
This is found when coming to the cross-lanes in
the hollow at Holcombe, one mile from Lea
Mount, by turning to the left down a tree-shaded
way known as “Smugglers’ Lane.” A short
distance brings the explorer to a sight of the sea
again, glimpsed between the stone arches of a
railway-bridge spanning a tiny cove or inlet.
A walk through the arches on to the sands, if
the tide be out, or the ascent of a dozen steps up
to the sea-wall, if it be in, brings the stranger into
the best and easiest, and certainly, into the most
beautiful, approach to Teignmouth, by the sea
the whole way and under the shadow of the
tremendous red cliffs, at whose foot the railway,
by the daring of Brunel, is made to run along the
most massive of sea-walls. The engineer here
wrought more picturesquely than he knew, and
performed an inestimable service to the public
by providing a ten-foot wide masonry pathway
nearly two miles and a half long, where the contemplative
visitor has the trains on one side and
the sea on the other; and where he may, when it
blows great guns off the sea, witness such a
spouting and a buffeting of furious waves against
the wall as scarce to be equalled around the coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The railway has here, at any rate, left the
shore more picturesque than it found it, and the
trains themselves give a last touch of romance.
You see them, in summer, coming down from
London, a wondering and expectant face thrust
from every window: the faces of holiday-makers
enraptured with the scene. You see the holiday-makers
again, a little later, with a deep tan
colour, but with expressions wistful and melancholy;
returning home, and taking a long lingering
glance before the Parson Tunnel finally occults
the view.</p>

<p>There is an added majesty to the sea-wall and
the railway when night is come. The red cliffs
become black and minatory, the trees and shrubs
against the skyline assuming weird shapes; and
stillness reigns; for mankind is gregarious and
congregates in the town, leaving the sea-wall to
shy lovers; and the contemplative crickets chirp
in the ballast and on the sleepers, and the wash
of the waves sounds in a restful undertone until
a red eye in the darkness along the line changes
to green and, with a rush and a scream, the express
thunders by.</p>

<span class="smaller">TEIGNMOUTH</span></h2>

<p>Teignmouth is the “second largest watering-place
in South Devon” and the most entirely
delightful. It was more delightful when it was
smaller; but that is a fact known only to people
old enough to have acquired memories of the
Has Been and to drag the clanking chains of
reminiscence and unavailing regret at their heels.
In the Teignmouth of yesterday there were no
pavements but those made of pebbles gleaned off
the beach, of the size and shape—and considerably
more than the hardness—of kidney potatoes. It
was a picturesque time, but painful for people
with tender feet and thin shoes, for the pavements
thus constructed were excruciatingly knobbly,
and were only worn down to the level after some
two generations and a half of wayfarers had
progressed over them. To-day you shall find
those old-style pavements only in the back streets
and alleyways of the town: in the main thoroughfares
you have paving-stones worthy of London
itself.</p>

<p>There was doubtless a time when these kidney-potato
pavements were looked upon as concessions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to a growing spirit of luxury, and it is conceivable
that, from the time when Teignmouth first arose
beside the azure main (somewhere about the
time of Edward the Confessor) until the first
quarter of the nineteenth century, the place did
very well without pavings or sidewalks of any
description. Sea-boots and shore-going footgear
an inch thick in the sole, and well hobnailed,
overcame any little difficulties with water, mud,
or shingle; and it was only when seaside holidays
first came into fashion and “visitors” appeared
that any fine distinctions were drawn between
roads and paths.</p>

<p>When the railway came to Teignmouth in
1846, it found a quiet, rather out-of-the-way
little town and port, of narrow and winding
streets, lined with rustic Devonian cob-built cottages,
alternating with what had been modish
little plaster-fronted villas with skimpy little
balconies and bow fronts. Many of them still
remain in the older part of the town, in French
Street and Hollands Road. If they were larger,
they would remind one of Brighton and the
Regency, but, in the miniature sort, they are
oddly reminiscent of Jane Austen and Mrs.
Gaskell and their ringleted heroines.</p>

<p class="caption">APPROACH TO TEIGNMOUTH.</p>
</div>

<p>In pre-railway days Teignmouth lay, as it
were, in an eddy of traffic. The mail coaches
went from Exeter to Plymouth far inland, and
only strictly local stages hugged the coastwise
roads; but with the opening of the South Devon
Railway, as it then was, Teignmouth at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
was placed on the main route from London to
the West. There should certainly be a statue of
Brunel on the Den at Teignmouth, for by planning
the railway to run along the coast he not only
made the fortune of the town, but added magnificently
to the picturesqueness of the shore, in
building that two and a half miles of massive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
sea-wall on which the railway comes into the
town.</p>

<p>Teignmouth is one of those very few places the
railway does not vulgarise, by bringing you in at
the back door, so to speak, and through the kitchen
and the scullery. You are brought along that sea
wall, in full view of a gorgeously-coloured coast,
into a fine airy station, expectant of the best, and
are not disappointed in that expectation; if, indeed,
a little mystified as to your bearings. To
acquire those bearings, the proper way, after all,
here as elsewhere, is to enter the town by road,
whether by the extravagantly hilly high road along
the cliff tops, or along the sea wall. That is the
geographically educative way, by which you shall
see how the original Teignmouth was built on a
flat sandy spit at the mouth of the Teign estuary,
and how by degrees it has grown upwards and
backwards, away from river and sea, even to the
lower slopes of the lofty moorland of Haldon.</p>

<p>The most outstanding peculiarity, and one of
the finest features of Teignmouth is “the Den,”
the wide sweep of lawn that ornaments the whole
of the seaward side of the town and at once stamps
Teignmouth as something wholly out of the
ordinary. “The Den,” properly “dene,” was
originally a flat sandy waste where the fishermen
of the old fishing town dried their nets, and when
the town suddenly was made to take on the appearance
of a fashionable resort, in the first quarter
of the nineteenth century, and a formal front
was built, looking upon the sea, the houses were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
planned in a huge crescent, following the lines of
that open space. Whether this was done from
choice or necessity does not appear, but it would
certainly seem that the builders of what was then
“modern” Teignmouth were offered no alternative,
and that they dared not lay hands upon what
was really common land.</p>

<p>Within the memory of many visitors to Teignmouth
the grassy Den has wonderfully improved.
A comparatively few years ago it was still scrubby
and common-like, and its bordering flower-beds
and rockeries were rich only in rocks, but the grass
now grows green, the flowers flourish, and sheltering
shrubs have grown phenomenally. The
fishermen still exercise their ancient prescriptive
right of spreading their seine nets out to dry on the
grass, but, for some reason or another, not so
greatly as before.</p>

<p>The sea-front of Teignmouth, following the
semi-circle of the Den, is decoratively imposing
when viewed at a little distance, for there is much
virtue, architecturally, in a crescent, however little
there may be in the houses individually. They
are ambitious buildings, chiefly in these times
boarding-houses, but with the “Royal Hotel” and
the ugly East Devon and Teignmouth Club prominent
among them. According to intention and
to the description given of the Club-house in local
literature, it is in the Ionic style, but seeing that
it is of brick and rubble, faced with plaster masquerading
as stone, we shall not be far wrong in
declaring that, in spite of—nay, because of—its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
colonnade of squatty columns pretending to be
Greek, its style is more fitly to be described as
“ironic.”</p>

<p>There is, indeed, a great deal of very bad architecture
in Teignmouth, of the pretentious kind;
very solid, stolid and ugly, and the newer houses,
although more pleasing to the eye, are generally
of an incredible flimsiness. If the natural scenery
of sea, land, and river were not so surprisingly
beautiful, the builders’ handiwork would long ago
have ruined Teignmouth, and it says much for the
natural advantages of the place that, although
there are less than half a dozen decent bits of
architecture, ancient or modern, in the town, it is
voted delightful by thousands of holiday-makers.</p>

<p>It is because I love Teignmouth so well that I
criticise it so closely. For the sake of the place
that nature has endowed so richly, one must needs
protest against the things that have been done,
the blunders and the vulgarities that have been
perpetrated. Was ever there a place where advertisements
could look more offensive? Yet the
entrance to the pier is smothered with them.
They stand boldly out against the scenery, and
your view across to Torbay or to Exmouth is
obliterated by the pushful poster and the
enamelled iron sign. Frankly, they are grievous
mistakes. One does not always want to be playing
Rogers’ pianos, nor even, for that matter, Paish’s;
and there are times—incredible though it may
seem—when Fry’s Cocoa and Dunville’s Whisky
are distinctly <i>de trop</i>. But enough!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Coming into Teignmouth by the sea-wall,
almost the first building met with is East Teignmouth
Church, almost wholly rebuilt in recent
years, from the 1887 Jubilee Tower downwards.
It is one of Teignmouth’s two parish churches that
once formed a couple owning the unenviable distinction
of being pre-eminently the ugliest churches
in all Devon, but now that the Jubilee and later
activities have utterly altered the aspect of this
church of St. Michael, East Teignmouth, that unlovely
brotherhood has been dissolved, and St.
James’s, West Teignmouth, reigns supreme in the
kingdom of the grotesque.</p>

<p>Not by any means that these much-criticised
buildings were offensively ugly. Their ugliness
was of that supreme and old-fashioned kind so
greatly prized in (for example) old china. It
transcended the merely ugly and rose into the
realms of the hideously quaint. St. Michael’s
tower, for instance, was a very gem of misbegotten
early nineteenth-century “Saxon” architecture,
done in grim grey stucco, and looking like the
architectural monstrosities of nightmare-land. It
would have genuinely astonished any Saxon
privileged to revisit the earth after a thousand
years and seeking the original Saxon building he
had known on this site. The present tower, in the
Perpendicular style, is ornately pinnacled and
windowed, and although so very florid, is a beautiful
and entirely successful feature. The almost
wave-washed position of St. Michael’s is a startling
surprise to the stranger, although the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and the congregation take it soberly enough; as
well they may, considering that, although it stands
so little removed from high-water mark, and
although the salt sea spray of winter’s storms flecks
its walls, the sea does not appear to have gained
the fraction of an inch since the first church arose
on this site, in the tenth century. On a wall of this
peculiarly seaside place of worship the stranger
may read a pathetic story of the sea, in the epitaph
to John and Richard Westlake, lost in the foundering
of the brig <i>Isla</i>, in the storm of October 29th,
1823, “within sight of this church.”</p>

<p>St. James’s church, the surviving ugly brother,
stands commandingly at the crest of the steep rise
through the town, at the entrance to Bitton. It
is often known as the “round church” because of
its central lantern tower, which is octagonal. It
is only with a difference I endorse the received
opinion among architectural critics that this church
of West Teignmouth is so ugly. Architecturally,
the lantern-tower and the odd octangular interior
additions made nearly a century ago are enormities,
but looked at from the lay point of view,
the whole mass of the building, while singular, is
imposing—and I am afraid the uninstructed
public rather like it.</p>

<p>This is almost enough about churches, save for
the fact that we are here come, in this beautiful
West country, into a deeply religious land, where
the Church of England weakens and Dissent takes
firm hold.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">TEIGNMOUTH—THE PLYMOUTH BRETHREN—THE
TEIGN—LITERARY ASSOCIATIONS</span></h2>

<p>The further West you go, the more distinctly religious
you find the people, and the stronger you
find the hold of Dissent upon them. Religion is
a very real thing in the West, and the more real it
is, the weaker is the hold of the Established Church.
Peculiarly strong, among other forms of Dissent,
are the Plymouth Brethren in Devonshire, and the
Bible Christians in Cornwall.</p>

<p>It should be said at once that “Plymouth
Brethren” is only the name by which the world
at large knows that body of Christians, who, like
the “Friends,” whom the world styles “Quakers,”
do by no means label themselves with any specific
title. They are among themselves just
“Brethren,” and their places of worship are
merely the “Brethren’s” meeting-rooms. The
“Plymouth Brethren,” who more closely than any
other sect resemble the Quakers, follow the practice
of the early Christians, insomuch that all are
brothers in Christ; and no dogma made of man,
nor any official hierarchy or pastorate, has yet
been suffered to obscure that essential fraternity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The “Plymouth Brethren”—to speak of them
by the style which the world has agreed to use—took
their origin about 1827, in the workings of
conscience of John Nelson Darby and A. N. Groves,
who, independently of one another, had arrived at
the conclusion that no existing church was firmly
based upon the Gospel. Darby, who was at that
time twenty-seven years of age, had been educated
for the law, but had entered the Church, and
was a curate in Ireland when the light that came
to him led to his resigning. He was brought into
communication with Groves, and in 1830 the first
meeting of the “Brethren” was opened, in Dublin.
That same year, on a visit to Oxford, Darby was
asked to open a meeting at Plymouth, whither he
forthwith proceeded and took “Providence
Chapel,” thus, with the spread of the movement
from that town, unwittingly giving a topographical
name to the new religious body.</p>

<p>The tenets of the “Brethren” are simple.
They rely upon the teaching and the promises of
the Gospel, and reject all ecclesiastical forms.
Like the Quakers, they have no ministers and no
prayer-books. Prayer at meeting is extempore,
and offered up when the Spirit moves, by members
of the meeting. It is thus, it will be seen, essentially
a democratic body, but in practice those
whose natural vocation is preaching, missioning
and district-visiting become more prominent, and,
if they feel they have a call, will obey that call by
giving up all worldly occupations. Those with a
sufficiency of means of their own, will give themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and their wealth to the work of the Master,
and those others who have nothing will devote
their lives to the work of spreading the Gospel,
visiting the sick, and in general performing the
salaried work of a clergyman of the Endowed

<p>Those who have once fallen under the spell of
Teignmouth are never likely to be freed from it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
You leave, after perhaps the fifth or sixth visit,
declaring you have exhausted the place, but you
inevitably return, if not next year, in the near
future. There is, in fact, something in Teignmouth
to please all tastes, and custom never
stales it. It enjoys that inestimable advantage
in a seaside resort, a tidal estuary; and round by
the sandspit, over against the bold red cliff of
the Ness, you come from the somewhat artificial
front and its pier and its seats for visitors, to the
harbour, where the Teign flows out at the ebb
and the sea comes swirling in at the flood, across
the shifting sand-bar that from time immemorial
has afforded a living for Teignmouth pilots and
tug-boats, bringing the craft of strange skippers,
ignorant of the state of the channel, safely into
the haven. There are no seats, or other such
concessions to visitors, in the harbour, but there
are boats innumerable for sailing or rowing upon
the Teign, and in the deep midstream anchorage
to one side of the sandbank called “the Salty,”
there is generally a tier of foreign barques that
have brought deals from Norway, or are to take
china-clay to the uttermost parts of the earth.
And there are ropes and anchors and much
waterside litter, and a fragrant scent of what
the sailors call “Stockhollum” tar about the
harbour; and if the visitor does not promptly
succeed in tripping over the ropes and chains and
anchors, why then he is an exceptional visitor
indeed. Fragrant sail-lofts look down upon the
water, and old superannuated buoys and other
buoys that only want a lick of paint, are drawn
up on the sand, and from the open windows of
sailors’ homes come the voices of parrots, mingled
not unmusically with a midstream yo-hoing.</p>

THE GREAT WESTERN RAILWAY.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The trade of Teignmouth harbour, after a
long period of decay, is in these times looking up,
for the South Devon Trading Company has built
new quays and sheds, which, like all new things,
do not add to the picturesqueness of the spot;
but the casual lanes and odd slips remain, with
the old quay, and that unconventional inn, “Newbery’s
Old Quay Hotel,” that with every flood-tide
dabbles its feet in the water, and with every ebb
stands once more upon dry ground, much to the
amazement and delight of children. Did I not
myself once think the “Old Quay” inn the most
desirable of all possible homes!</p>

<p>There is a homeliness in the harbour that draws
the visitor away from the exotic front, and it is
to the harbour he first resorts when he revisits
Teignmouth, for it seems almost to welcome him
back. There, up stream, is that hoary old
landmark, the long bridge that spans the Teign,
which is 1,671 feet in length, and was built in 1827,
and is the longest wooden bridge in England.
“Further on,” as the guide-book says, “are the
gas-works.” It is only too true, and they might,
with advantage to the scenery, be still further
on; but in that case they would not get their
coal barged cheaply up to the very walls, which
everybody knows to be a greater consideration
than the preservation of mere scenic amenities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Away in the misty distance are the tors of
Dartmoor, prominent among them Rippon Tor
and Heytor Rocks, grey-bearded—as you know
when you have visited them—with sage-green
lichen, and altogether very reverend and inscrutable.
They seem with a grave benevolence to
welcome you back.</p>

<p class="caption">THE NESS: ENTRANCE TO THE TEIGN.</p>
</div>

<p>Above Teignmouth is Haldon, that vast expanse
of tableland whose heights we first saw from
Exmouth, and whose range—marked on maps
“Great Haldon” and “Little”—extends across
the whole of the back country between Exe and
Teign. He who, in search of fresh air and vigour
on some stewing day in the Teign valley, essays
to climb from Teignmouth to Little Haldon,
comes, very soon after he has set out, and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
long before he has arrived, to the conclusion that
the “littleness” of Little Haldon is a misnomer;
for the way is long and the road steep. But once
there, you are in another and more bracing
climate, where the air is keen and charged with
the scent of the bracken and the heather that
clothe the wild moorland. From Haldon you
look one way to the Exe and the other to the
Teign, and, standing in one and the selfsame spot,
can see both, for it is an exceeding high place.
The solitude of it is perhaps intensified to some
by the fact of Teignmouth’s cemetery being here;
but it is a large and a populous place, and to those
of us who knew in life many who lie here, this is
no solitude. God rest them. The summer sun
that shines on Haldon shines no more for them,
nor winter storms blow.</p>

<p>Although Teignmouth has its literary and
artistic associations, it does by no means obtrude
them upon the stranger, who, indeed, only discovers
them after some considerable pains, and
is perhaps regarded as a little eccentric, for his
trouble. Two poets—Winthrop Mackworth Praed,
and John Keats—have described the town, and
although Praed was not actually born here, the
connection with the family was close, the Bitton
property belonging to his father, who lies in the
churchyard of West Teignmouth. Bitton, in
fact, only passed from the Praeds in 1863. The
poet was born in 1802 and died in 1839, when
member of Parliament for Aylesbury.</p>

<p>There are reasons all-sufficient why Teignmouth’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
poetic associations should not be flaunted.
Too great insistence upon Praed would advertise
more fully the brutal vandalism permitted of
late years at Bitton, when no finger was stirred
to save that lovely wooded riverside park from
being cut up and demolished, to build cheap
houses upon. Bitton was one of the loveliest
places upon the Teign. In the words of Praed
himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“There beamed upon the river side</div>
<div class="verse indent2">A shady dwelling-place</div>
<div class="verse">Most beautiful! Upon that spot,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Beside the echoing wave,</div>
<div class="verse">A fairy might have built her grot,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">An anchorite his grave.</div>
<div class="verse">The river with its constant fall</div>

<div class="verse">To look into the charms within.</div>
<div class="verse">Behind majestic mountains frowned</div>
<div class="verse">And dark, rich groves were all around.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The “dark, rich groves,” were no mere poetic
imagery. They were largely ilex, or “evergreen
oak,” for which streets of the flimsiest houses in
close-packed ranks are the sorriest exchange.</p>

<p>Keats, of course, no self-respecting Devonian
would mention. He came, himself consumptive,
to Teignmouth in 1818, to cheer the last hours
of his brother Tom, dying of that disease. Here,
lodging at No. 35, Strand, he completed <i>Endymion</i>
and wrote <i>Isabella</i>; but it was winter and spring
at the time of his sojourn, and although spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and winter in South Devon are preferable to those
seasons elsewhere, he found the moist humours
of the rainy West anything but pleasant:</p>

<p>“You may say what you will of Devonshire:
the truth is, it is a splashy, rainy, misty, snowy,
foggy, haily, floody, muddy, slipshod county.
The hills are very beautiful, when you get a sight
of ’em; the primroses are out, but you are in;
the cliffs are of a fine deep colour, but then the
clouds are continually vieing with them. … The
flowers here wait as naturally for the rain twice
a day as mussels do for the tide. This Devonshire
is like Lydia Languish, very entertaining
when it smiles, but cursedly subject to sympathetic
moisture.”</p>

<p>But occasionally the weather was kinder. It
does not rain all day and every day in Devon,
even in winter; and during these dry interludes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Keats discovered some of those amazingly many
villages that owe their name to the Teign:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“There’s Bishop’s Teign,</div>
<div class="verse">And King’s Teign,</div>
<div class="verse">And Coombe at the clear Teignhead—</div>
<div class="verse">Where close by the stream</div>
<div class="verse">You may have your cream</div>
<div class="verse">All spread upon barley bread.</div>
<div class="verse">There is Newton Marsh,</div>
<div class="verse">With its spear-grass harsh,</div>
<div class="verse">A pleasant summer level</div>
<div class="verse">Where the maidens sweet</div>
<div class="verse">Of the Market Street</div>
<div class="verse">Do meet in the dusk to revel.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A poet <i>en deshabille</i>. Reduced from poetry to
the matter-of-fact nomenclature of the ordnance
maps, those places are Bishopsteignton, Kingsteignton,
and Coombe-in-Teignhead—the “Cumeintinny”
of local speech. The poet who might
wish to know all the “Teign” villages and
hamlets, would need to make acquaintance with
Teignharvey and Stokeinteignhead, on the salt
estuary; and thence find his way inland, to the
back of Newton Abbot, where, beside the freshwater
stream that comes prattling down from
Dartmoor he shall find Teigngrace, Canonteign,
and Drewsteignton.</p>

<p>For six miles above Teignmouth the Teign
runs up salt: a broad estuary at high water: above
the bridge an oozy expanse of mingled sand and
mud flats at low; and “Newton Marsh,” the
water-logged meadows just below the market<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
town and important railway junction of Newton
Abbot. Midway is Coombe Cellars, a waterside
offshoot of Coombe-in-Teignhead; a place, you
perceive, even in Keats’ time, it was the recognised
thing to visit and—</p>

<p class="caption">COOMBE CELLARS.</p>
</div>

<p>It was then a highly rustic spot; the oddest
little promontory jutting out into the stream,
and on it the “Ferry Boat” inn, built behind
stout sea walls, and itself built of whitewashed
cob, and heavily thatched. The “Cellars” were
fish cellars, and the place was, and is, oddly
amphibious; the inn being half farmhouse and
half fisherman’s tavern, the landlord himself a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
farmer down to the waist, and a fisherman as to
the legs and the sea-boots. At night you would
find him out with the trawl-nets, to sea; at low
tide in the morning cockling on the mud-flats off
his inn; and in the afternoon milking the cows
or urging the plough in his hillside fields. To take
boat from Teignmouth Harbour, and row up on
the flood to tea at Coombe Cellars, returning with
the ebb, was once a delightful thing, and, with
a difference, is so still; but you must not expect
to be the only party there—no, not by a very long
way, and you must by no means expect to get
your tea, with or without Devonshire junket,
strawberries and cream, or cockles, in quite so
rustic a fashion or at such moderate prices as once
obtained. And, although the house remains very
much the same as of yore, the thatch has given
place to a something less rural.</p>

<span class="smaller">SHALDON—LABRADOR—WATCOMBE—ST. MARYCHURCH—BABBACOMBE</span></h2>

<p>At the point, just where the river and the sea
meet, off the toy lighthouse, is the noblest view of
the Ness, the great red bluff that turns a jagged
front to the sea, and lifts a shaggy head of firs to
the sky. With a dark and oily smoothness that
betokens depth and strength of current, the
estuary of the Teign empties itself at the ebb, and
fills again with feathered spray on yonder rocks.
Above Shaldon, opposite, rise the great hills, up
whose sides climbs the road to Torquay: hills
fertile to their very summits, and remarkable for
their subdivision by hedgerows all the way up
those staggering gradients. From nowhere better
than from Teignmouth can this beautiful and
characteristic feature of a Devonshire landscape
be seen.</p>

<p>Let us leave Teignmouth here by the ferry-boat,
in preference to walking over the long
bridge. Both bridge and ferry belong to one
company, and the toll each way, by either of
them is the same modest penny. The ferry goes
from one sandy beach to another, touching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
opposite shore immediately under the roadway,
the little forecourt gardens, and the bow-windowed
houses of Shaldon, which seems to the stranger
the oddest, brightest, cleanest and most quiet of
townlets, and for a while puts Teignmouth in the
shade. Shaldon, however, is very much of a
“dead end,” a backwater, or still pool of life,
and when the visitors are gone, when the children
have deserted the warm sands, and the half-dozen
ferry boats that are required in summer are
reduced to two; and when nature, with autumn
past, frugally turns the lights down until next
spring, Shaldon is apt to be dull. But there is
always the harbour to look out upon, and Teignmouth
across the river; although, to be sure,
there is the reverse view of the harbour and of
Shaldon from Teignmouth. For myself, I incline
to think the outlook upon the harbour and Shaldon
and the hills from Teignmouth the best, especially
since the appearance on the Bitton estate of those
houses you wot of. But this is certain, while
human nature remains true to itself: wherever
you are not, there you would be, just as, whatever
you are doing, you look forward to the doing of
something quite different; or else, doing nothing,
yearn to be busy, and being busy, long for idleness.</p>

<p>It is a rocky scramble round beyond the Ness
to the open sea and Labrador, and no one,
fortunately, has yet engineered a neat path that
way. For one thing, it would be scarce worth the
trouble of doing so while great fragments of rock
come hurtling down from the cliff, thrust out by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the frosts and thaws of winter. The way is strewn
with these immense pieces of red conglomerate,
weighing anything from five to twenty tons; and
those who wear india-rubber shoes and can best
imitate the chamois in rock-leaping are those
who like best the exploration of the Ness. For
others there is that “harvest of the quiet eye”
down in the rock-pools that the tide has left,
where, among the trailing seaweeds, the limpet
clings with the tightness of a moribund government
clinging to power, and only to be removed
in the same way; by the sudden, unexpected blow,
like the Parliamentary snap-division; where transparent
things, showing their inwards in the most
indelicate way, flit about unconcerned at that
publicity, and the hermit-crab justifies his sponsors
by hurrying, presto, to some rocky cell when you
disturb this little <i>mare clausum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Tumbled rock-heaps, alternating with beaches,
lead to the foot of the cliff by whose up-on-end
path you breathlessly reach Labrador, a place
known to every one who has visited Teignmouth.
Local traditions tell how this cottage and garden,
half-way up the four hundred feet of cliff, were
the work of a retired sea-captain who, settling
here from a long career in the Newfoundland
trade, christened the place by the name it still
bears. I do not suppose he ever contemplated
it being converted into a picnic inn, but he <i>may</i>
have had an eye to a snug little traffic in smuggling,
for which in his time it must have been especially
adapted.</p>

<p>However that may be, there is no questioning
the popularity of Labrador, where teas are
provided and swings tempt the giddy-minded,
and roses clamber over the house-front in a
manner suggestive of Persia and Omar Khayyàm.
Why, with leisure—and genius—one might compose
another <i>Rabaiyat</i> when the tea-takers were
gone.</p>

<p>“I reckon,” says one of the soil, whom we
meet here and exchange remarks with, “Twize up
and down es a gude day’s work,” and it really
is a leg-aching job to climb to the top of the cliff,
which must be done to gain the Torquay road.
South Devon is sleepy, and, experiencing this
steepest of paths and hottest of hot corners, the
stranger is not surprised. At any time it is
possible to sit down and drop into a “bit of a
zog”—which is Devonian for a nap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The Torquay road is inexorably hilly and
white and hot, but it looks inland down on to
samples of Canaan, where, amid a blue haze of
fertility, you see trees and grass more nearly blue
than green, among the freshly turned fields that
are red. It is a land of fatness. There, down
in those folded valleys, is a distant glimpse of the
Teign, with the white-faced, yellow-thatched
cottages of “Stokeintinny” and “Cumeintinny”
enwrapped in an air of prosperity; and here is
the ridge-road, like an oven. “Aw! my dear
sawls, ’tes tar’ble hot.”</p>

<p>Here stands the old toll-house the country
folk call “Solomon’s Post”; but why? Ah!
he who pervades the country asking for the
reasons of things is not to be envied. For my
part, the likeliest reason of this name is that
the tolls on this turnpike-trust may have been
farmed by one of those numerous Jews who took
up that class of business.</p>

<p>Lanes on the left-hand presently lead down
to Minnicombe and Maidencombe, where there
are embowered hamlets giving upon the sea;
and in another mile yet another leads down to
Watcombe. Watcombe is not what it was fifteen
years ago. Then a countryfied lane opened out
upon a grassy valley dropping to the sea. From
the turf there soared aloft the ruddiest of all the
ruddy cliffs of South Devon, seamed and seared
with the weathering of ages, and as thickly
pocketed with holes as a Post Office <i>poste-restante</i>
rack. The cliff is there, as ever, and the holes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and the pigeons and jackdaws that inhabit them,
but the undergrowth has grown up in dense and
tangled masses everywhere, the hedges of the
rustic lane have given place to stone walls, and
all the pleasant approaches are enclosed in the
grounds of somebody’s private domain. Confound
Somebody, say I: may the dogs defile the
grave of his great-great-grandmother. But let
us take these outrages as calmly as we may, or
not seek to further explore; for the approach
to Torquay through Babbacombe and Marychurch
is a perfect orgie of Wall. It must have been
a difficult and an expensive matter to so successfully
shut out the scenery, but it has been so
thoroughly done that when you do at last come
to the cliff-top of Babbacombe Downs, the lovely
clear outlook there over the sea and down to the
beach seems, by contrast, like a hole in the wall.</p>

<p>But we anticipate, as the authors of Early
Victorian novels were accustomed to remark,
and have not finished with Watcombe, which is
remarkable for having supplied the Romans with
potters’-clay and for providing us moderns with
the same material. The Watcombe Terracotta
Works, that stand by the high road, were established
somewhere about 1875. Their products
of statuettes for advertising purposes are sufficiently
well-known, and I dare not hazard a
guess how many of that famous group, “You
Dirty Boy!” the works produced for an eminent
firm of soap-makers. When what has been called
the “Æsthetic Craze” set in, and all manner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
weird wares, alleged to have some “Art” quality,
were thrust upon the public, the Watcombe terracottas
were fashioned in the most awkward and
“artistic” shapes, and painted with sunflowers
and the most abhorrent colours, and in them
that good, long-suffering public for a time found
artistic salvation. But that was long ago, and
the sunflower has wilted and the lily faded away.
To-day, rustic humour and Old English models
combined, capture the tourist. Puzzle-jugs and
scraps of country talk find the readiest sale, and
many a holiday-maker takes home with him
butter-dishes, jugs, and plates with such legends
as “Go aisy with the butter,” “Help yo’self to
some Demsher crayme,” or that noble triolet—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">Du gude ef yo can,</div>
<div class="verse">Du zummat.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Beyond Watcombe begins St. Marychurch.
At the threshold of that suburb a long lane leads
to the left, down to Pettitor, where there are busy
quarries of Devon Marble, so greatly in favour
with church-furnishers that specimens of it are
nowadays to be found in use, not in England
only, but in remote parts of the world.</p>

<p>You would not for a moment suspect the
Domesday antiquity of St. Marychurch, but it
appears in that remarkable work—as a church—the
earliest, it is said, in Devon. Rebuilt in 1861,
it is now merely one of the many ornate places
of worship in which Torquay, with its large, rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and idle residential classes, greatly priest-ridden,
abounds. Only the ancient font, sculptured with
a number of engaging devils, remains.</p>

<p>St. Marychurch would probably not produce
so much disfavour in the beholder were it not
for its natural surroundings. This is a parable,
but one easily resolved into a plain statement.
The place is, in short, a bad nightmare of plaster.
<i>Quâ</i> plaster, not so very shocking, but taken in
conjunction with the exceptionally lovely nature of
the scenery, nothing less than a crime. A wanton,
indefensible crime, too, for the neighbourhood
abounds with excellent limestone, most suitable
for building. I conceive there must be something
radically wrong—beyond a mere error of taste—with
the generations that will go out of their
way to use a short-lived pretence like plaster,
when limestone, calculated to last until the
universe shall again be thrown into the melting-pot,
offers. But there, it is done, and not
unless all Torquay itself were razed to the ground,
and the place begun anew, could it be remedied.
Oddly enough, the first signs of enlightenment
in this direction are shown by the various banks,
which are being substantially and tastefully built
of honest materials.</p>

<p>The long, long streets lead past Furrow Cross,
where, turning to the left, along the Babbacombe
Down Road, that lovely opening, looking out
upon the sea, is disclosed. Here, from the carefully
railed-in cliff-edge, one looks sheer down
on to the white pebble beaches of Oddicombe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and Babbacombe, with winding walks through
luxuriant greenery, leading hundreds of feet
down to them. Red cliffs, white beaches, dark
blue sea, light blue sky, and the cool green of the
vegetation; what a feast of colour is the South
Devon Coast! And the abounding growth of
flowers and shrubs in the gardens on these heights!
Geraniums, putting to shame the best efforts of
ivy a-clinging and climbing: fuchsias, making
growth like trees, with substantial trunks; veronica
shrubs in hedges, the lovely blue masses of
the heliotrope-like ceanothus, and others of the
acclimatised beauties of the Southern Hemisphere:
all these glories are rendered possible by the soft
climate, which laps you as in cotton wool, and
takes all the energy out of you, and has rendered
the folk of Devon the kindly lotus-eaters they
are.</p>

to Babbacombe, but for all their circumbendability
(what a lovely word that is!) they are so
steep that by far the easiest way to descend
would be to get down on to your hinder parts,
and slide. To those who are not so young as
they were, the view down upon the beach of
Babbacombe, and upon the roof-tops of its few
houses is the better part, for the walking down
jolts the internal machinery most confoundedly.
Why, there are few more pitiful sights on this
earth—which we know, on eminent authority,
to be a “wale”—than that of a middle-aged <i>and</i>
stout gentleman gingerly descending these walks,
and sighing with envy as a troop of children dash,
whooping, past him. <i>Their</i> actions have not yet
begun to be regulated by their digestive apparatus!</p>

<p>But for all that indiarubber-like infantile
irrepressibility, I have seen a little childish disaster
here. It was a fall and a bruise and a scratched
face that meant little, after all; but the howls
of that child were worthy of an occasion infinitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
more tragical. It were not worth dwelling upon,
except that it opened out some rustic Devon talk,
when a son of the soil set that injured innocent
upon his feet again and said: “Well done! My
eymers: ’av ’ee valled down?”</p>

<p>With so much sympathy on tap, my young
martyr began to pity himself infinitely, and sobbed
the more. “Did ’ur, then?” said that kindly
comforter: “puir liddle bye, puir liddle bleed.
You ’m proper ’urted yo’self, have ’ee. Where’s
his mammy, then? Where do ’ee live tu? Coom
’ee up-along an’ zittee on this zeat,” and much
else.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of these exploited seaside
towns are, however, not the places, as a
general rule, in which to look for such fine survivals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of old Devon talk. The villages and
the hamlets are the last homes of it, and, generally
speaking, the only times when an indweller hears
the Doric is when a servant, fresh-caught from
“Dartymoor” or other remote district, comes
into residence. Then, indeed, one hears strange
phrases. <i>Then</i> you learn, if you did not know it
before, that in Devon all girls are “maads” and
all boys “byes,” large or small; or I should say,
in the Devon tongue, “gert” or “liddle.” In
Devon most things that are thorough, or difficult,
or to be expressed in terms of bigness or admiration
are “proper,” and this expression, among some
others, is not, like much else of the rustic talk,
obsolescent. It is, indeed, common in towns, and
seems, like the Devonian soft burring inflection,
to be, after a period of disuse, coming back again.</p>

<p>Anything very large is thus said to be “proper
gert”; a difficult task is still a “proper chore”;
and—although to one not used to the West the
propriety of it is not evident—a person helplessly
intoxicated is “proper drunk,” or “durnk”
may even be said; for (as in “gert” for “great”)
your true West countryman will always, whenever
humanly possible, depose the letter “r” from
its proper place. He will overcome majestic
difficulties in this linguistic way, and will even
“urn” instead of “run.”</p>

<p>A Devonian never lives “at” a place, only
“tu” it; baskets to him are either “flaskets”
or “maunds”; he has a staggering way of saying
“Well done!” as an exclamation of surprise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
even on the most tragical occasions, so that he
has seemed sometimes, to strangers who are not
acquainted with this peculiarity, to be callously
superhuman or less than human; which is a libel
on the kindly race.</p>

<p>Babbacombe—the real Babbacombe of the
beach, not the strange new thing on the cliff-top—is
the tiniest of places, with the “Cary Arms”
inn, a little stone fishing-pier, a few boats, a
fortuitous concourse of lobster-pots, a windlass or
two, and a general air of being a natural growth,
as indeed it is. It seems remote from the evil
passions of the world, but for all that seeming,
it was the scene of a dreadful tragedy in 1884,
when Miss Keyse, an elderly lady who lived in a
picturesquely thatched cottage on the very margin
of the beach, was murdered by John Lee, her
manservant. He was a young footman, a native
of Kingskerswell. The motive was said to have
been revenge for the reduction of his wages by
sixpence a week. The whole thing is sordid,
and one had rather not mention it at all; only
the notoriety of the case compels. Lee saturated
the rooms with petroleum and set fire to the house,
in the hope of concealing the evidence of his
crime, but fortunately the fire was extinguished
before it had made sufficient progress, and the
marks on the body were discovered and Lee
arrested. He was tried, found guilty, sentenced
to death, and actually brought to the scaffold
at Exeter Gaol; but there the strange and unparalleled
circumstances occurred which saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
him from execution and condemned him to lifelong
imprisonment instead. Three several times
the trap-door on which the condemned man stood
refused to fall when the bolt was drawn, although
each time, when he was led away, and it was tried,
it worked properly. After the third attempt, it
was decided, in the interest of the official spectators
and of the wretched criminal himself, to prolong
the harrowing scene no longer, and Lee was removed
to his cell and a report sent to the Home
Secretary who first respited him and then commuted
the sentence to imprisonment for life.</p>

<p>These are supposed to be materialistic times,
when everything is held to have some discoverable
natural cause, and the failure of the trap is explained
by the wood of it being swollen, and jamming
every time a weight was placed upon it.
But the affair was so remarkable, that very
naturally the whole country was deeply stirred.
Those who were present never lightly dismissed
the subject, and for one’s self, it seems very like
God’s protest against man’s injustice. But we,
who were not present and are not thrown off our
balance by the dreadful experience, <i>must</i> consider
that in the long history of the world many innocent
persons have been hanged, and Providence stirred
no finger on their behalf, while many assassins
have escaped the Avenger of Blood. It should
be said that local opinion has always been strong
in the belief of Lee’s guilt.</p>

<p>The house, one is glad to say, exists no longer.
Only an outhouse which belonged to it remains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and the rest of the site is dense with trees and
undergrowth. In spite of repeated rumours of
his release, Lee is still in prison, nor does it appear
likely that he will ever be permitted to go at
liberty again.</p>

<p>One of the most famous spots on this coast
is that to which we now come. Anstey’s Cove has
been described and pictured times innumerable,
and I—ah! me—am going to do it again. The
way to the Cove lies in between the inevitable
dead walls of the district: <i>these</i> the high and solid
ones built by Bishop Phillpotts of Exeter some
fifty years since, to enclose the grounds of his
villa of “Bishopstowe” and keep the public out
of all possible glimpses of this paradise: highly
characteristic of a bishop.</p>

<p>These walls must have been extremely ugly
when newly built, but nature, more kindly than
the dignified clergy, has toned down the rawness,
assuaged the harsh lines and set a green mantle
over the bishop’s walls, so that they are now
stony cliffs, lichened and moss-grown, rich in tiny
ferns, and overhung by tall trees.</p>

<p>The bishop was, like many of the cloth, a man
of sarcastic wit; for when a lady, visiting him at
Bishopstowe, gushingly exclaimed how like Torquay
was to Switzerland, he retorted very neatly
with, “Yes, only <i>there</i> you have mountains and
no sea, and here we have sea and no mountains.”</p>

<p>Anstey’s Cove is the same as ever: one of the
few places that have not changed of late years.
Still the path leads down ruggedly to the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
beach of big white marble pebbles, still the hollow
is filled with a wild ferny brake and with old
thorn-trees, hung, like the liana-choked forest
trees of South America, with tangled strands of
wild clematis. And although the original Thomas,
who, half a century ago supplied picnics with
necessaries, has long since assumed his crown
and robe of white up above, the poetic notice-board
written for him still survives, and Thomases of a
later generation are to be found in their wooden
shanty on the beach, where they continue the
traditions—or some of them—of:</p>

<p>Some enthusiastic scholar has even done this
into Latin, and the result is seen on the wooden
walls of the shanty.</p>

<p>White limestone pinnacles shut in the eastern
side of the Cove, and shade off into pink and red
and grey. On the western side a cliff path goes
winding round the headland of Hope’s Nose and
Daddy Hole Plain. The Hole there is a rift in
the plateau, and “Daddy,” the affectionate name
bestowed upon the Devil by local folk, who
perhaps did not stop to consider when they did
it that they thus proclaimed themselves children
of Satan.</p>

<p>On the inland road to Torquay is that famous
place, Kent’s Cavern, whose prehistoric contents
led men of science to wholly revise their ideas of
the world’s history.</p>

<p>The situation of Kent’s Cavern, although only
a mile from the centre of Torquay and in the Wellswood
suburb, is still semi-rural. A limestone bluff,
shaggy with bushes, trees and ivy, rises abruptly
to the right of the road, and in the side of it is a
locked wooden door, upon which you bang and
kick for the guide, who is guide, proprietor, and
explorer in one. When he is not guiding, he is
engaged in digging and turning over the wet red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
earth, alone in the dank lonesomeness with the
spirits of prehistoric man and the bones of the
extinct animals that ranged the valleys of Torquay
when the world was young. The freehold of the
famous cavern which ever since 1824 has been
the theme of more or less learned geological
treatises was recently sold at auction for a trifling
sum; not to an institution or a scientific society but
to the guide, who has conducted many geological
pundits over it, and by consequence has acquired
an air of greater omniscience than the most completely
all-knowing of those not remarkably
modest men of science.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus30">
<img src="images/illus30.jpg" width="400" height="275" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ANSTEY’S COVE.</p>
</div>

<p>No one really knows who was that Kent whose
name the cavern bears. The popular notion that
the place was only discovered in modern times is
an error, for evidences exist of its being known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
through the Middle Ages, down to our own time.
The prehistoric remains, and not the cavern itself,
are the modern finds, and that there were visitors
and curiosity-hunters in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries is evident in the names scratched
on the rocky walls, and still visible through the
slowly growing film of stalactite. Thus “William
Petre, 1571,” writes himself, by the mere fact of his
scribbling here, ancestor of the ’Arries of to-day,
and of the same glorious company is one who boldly
inscribes himself “Robert Hedges of Ireland,
Feb. 20, 1688.” This was no Irishman, but a
Devonshire yeoman from a farm or hamlet called
“Ireland,” on the other side of Dartmouth.</p>

<p>It remained for modern times to thoroughly
explore this natural rift in the limestone. There
were several very potent reasons why this should
not have been done before. Perhaps a little dread
of the unknown was partly the cause; geological
science was in its infancy, and in this then solitary
neighbourhood there was no one leisured enough,
or sufficiently interested, to investigate.</p>

<p>It was in 1824 Mr. Northmoore first broke
into the stalagmite floor which to a depth of three
inches formed a continuous covering, like concrete,
to the red clay and its deposits of flint implements,
charred bones, and relics of the hyæna, mammoth,
reindeer, bison, bear, wild cat, and a host of other
animals utterly extinct.</p>

<p>Above these relics of an almost incredible antiquity
was a layer of black earth containing remains
of the British and Roman periods, odds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
ends of whetstones, spindle-wheels, bone awls and
chisels, amber beads, bronze rings, pieces of Samian
pottery, and cakes of smelted copper, intermingled
with shells of sea-fish and bones of pigs, sheep, rats,
rabbits, and birds; the discarded things of periods
of occupation ranging from two thousand years
ago; but, compared with the deposits of from ten
to twenty thousand years earlier, beneath the
stalagmite flooring, things merely of yester-year.</p>

<p>Northmoore’s discoveries, however, were few
in comparison with those of the Rev. J. MacEnery,
who, as Roman Catholic chaplain at Tor Abbey,
had abundant leisure, and devoted three years,
from 1825, to explorations here. He saw a sight
that would have doubtless roused a dentist to
wildest enthusiasm. Nothing less than “the
finest fossil teeth I had ever seen.” He was followed
by Pengelly, and by the long series of researches
by the British Association, extending
from 1864 to 1880, which resulted in the almost
complete stripping of the cavern; so that we who
explore Kent’s Cavern, the home of Prehistoric
Man, to-day are very much in the position of
visitors to a house that has had the brokers in, or
a museum whose exhibits have been nearly all
removed.</p>

<p>But there are still remains discovered which
recall Pengelly’s description of the cave being
tenanted at the same period both by men and wild
animals; the cave-men going forth to fish or hunt
and the hyænas looking in during their absence for
anything worth picking up. And there are things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
belonging to remote geological periods which are
of those discoveries that first upset the chronology
of the Book of Genesis and gave staggering shocks
to believers in the absolute literal accuracy of the
Bible: teeth of wild animals, not merely in the
deposits of the floor, but embedded in the limestone
rock overhead. Who shall put a date to these?</p>

<p>And here, at our elbow all the while, is the
guide, complacently pointing to all these things;
lighting flares which disclose the roof, and playing
scales with sticks on metallic-sounding stalactites
that have been forming with incredible slowness,
perhaps an inch in a thousand years, just to be
made a show of. The best of all the stalactites
is broken. It began to be formed when the world
was young. It grew and grew with the drops of
water, charged with lime, percolating from the
roof, and being met by its fellow stalagmite with
equal slowness rising from the floor. And stalactite
and stalagmite had nearly met, and only
wanted another three or four centuries to bridge
the remaining interval of an eighth of an inch,
when a visitor, falling accidentally against them,
broke them off!</p>

<p>“What did you say?” one, with pardonable
curiosity, asks the guide, and “What <i>could</i> you
say?” says he; and when you consider it, <i>what</i>
is there that would be equal to that tremendous
occasion?</p>

<span class="smaller">ILSHAM GRANGE—MEADFOOT—TORQUAY</span></h2>

<p>In this quiet and wooded nook near Kent’s Cavern,
tucked away from the octopus arms of Torquay, is
Ilsham Grange, a chance survival of those old
times when Tor Abbey ruled the roast in these
parts. Everything here was then agricultural.
Not even a village, only the monks’ farm, relieved
the solitude. Traces of those old farmers remain
in the grey turret in the farmyard, where the
pigeons flutter and the pigs grunt contentedly,
blissfully unconscious of what pork, ham, and
bacon mean. In this turret, now with the floors
gone, Brother this, that, or t’other, sent over from
the Abbey round the headland, lodged, and ruled
from it the <i>conversi</i>, or lay-brothers, whose business
it was to conduct the practical farming and to be
as the Children of Gibeon, hewers of wood and
drawers of water for the community.</p>

<p>From Ilsham you come, over the hill, to Meadfoot,
a particularly noble bay, where the road is
protected from the sea by a wall calculated to
make a builder of cheap houses and nine-inch
party-walls faint with horror at so prodigal a use
of material. I do not know exactly <i>how</i> thick the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Meadfoot sea-wall is, but a wheeled conveyance
could be driven along it, if it were not so rough.
And the roughness of these rudely quarried, undressed
rocky boulders is just the fitting character
for the spot; which is, as I have said, a very
noble piece of coast-scenery indeed, rough-hewed
by nature in the large, and coloured by her in the
rich and sober hues of the rocks, alternating with
the brighter tints of sea and grass. Great islanded
rocks stand off-shore, glooming over the blue sea
like ogreish strongholds: the black monstrous
forms of the Ore Stone and the Thatcher Rock,
with the smaller Shag Rock close in, and a scatter
of reefs just off the sands.</p>

<p>Near by, but hidden from view by its enclosing
grounds, is that semicircular group of villa residences,
Hesketh Crescent, built, some forty years
ago, on the model of the classic terraces of Bath
and Buxton. Little postern gates lead from the
grounds on to the road at Meadfoot, and from
them the early riser on summer mornings may
observe strange figures, clad in gorgeous dressing-gowns,
shuffling in bath slippers to the sea, the
bright sunshine making heliographs of their bald
and shining pates. It all looks like some newer
version of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, or the <i>Swiss Family
Robinson</i>; but these old gentlemen are only the
retired generals and colonels of Hesketh Crescent,
out for their morning dip, and are so little like
marooned inhabitants of uncivilised isles that they
will presently enter their postern-gates again, and
go home to breakfast and the morning paper, over
which they will with fervour and unction damn
the War Office and the Army from head to foot—a
valued privilege denied to Robinson Crusoe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus32">

<p class="caption">MEADFOOT, AND THE ORE STONE AND THATCHER ROCK.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The entrance to the awful sanctities of Hesketh
Crescent is passed on the ascent from Meadfoot
into Torquay; but the Crescent is not what it was,
and boards, actually proclaiming houses to let,
disfigure the proprieties of its threshold. As a
matter of fact, the taste—or rather, the fashion—which
obtained when Hesketh Crescent was built
has wholly changed, and residents by the seaside
are no longer content to live in a continuous row
of houses. It is an unavoidable condition in great
towns, but most undesirable for a place like
Torquay, whose ideal is detachment, and whose
chief feature, in the residential districts, away
from the business centre, is the multitude of discreet
villas, each enclosed in its grounds, behind
masonry walls and shrubberies. If these villas
were situated near the Regent’s Park district of
London, the discretion of encompassing walls and
screening shrubberies would be referred to motives
not here to be discussed, but Torquay being what
it is, these features are but marks of the strictly
proper seclusion that is an essential feature of its
existence; an emotionless existence punctuated
by the visits of gibbering curates and the meetings
of Dorcas Societies.</p>

<p>Nothing is more remarkable in the later
history of Torquay than the number of “literary
landmarks” and associations it has gathered to
itself; more particularly associations connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
with the spinster lady authors of improving stories.
Torquay, of course, is not merely the place for
invalid visitors in the winter, but a place of residence
for many delicate persons to whom its
genial warmth is the very breath of life. It would
seem that when contemplative persons of a certain
fragility seek a permanent home, they come to
Torquay and write stories like <i>Christy’s Old Organ</i>
and <i>Jessica’s First Prayer</i>. At any rate, the
remarkable little shilling book, <i>Literary Landmarks
of Torquay</i>, by Mr. W. J. Roberts, discovers
an amazing number of literary associations, with
Charles Kingsley, P. H. Gosse, W. E. Norris, and
Eden Phillpotts at their head, and a regiment of
ladies bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>The seven hills—or more—on which Torquay
is built are dotted plentifully with the largest and
finest of these quiet villas, and the hollows in between
are cut up into winding roads, where the
stranger may speedily lose his bearings. If you
consult a plan of Torquay, it will be perceived that
the roads of its residential districts are like so
many vermiculations, returning upon one another
and intertwining almost with the intricacy of
whorls in a Celtic design. It must have been far
easier to find one’s way about the site of Torquay
a century ago than now, and in many respects it
was surely a more desirable place. From existing
records one may form a very exact picture of it,
say in 1815, when the long-dreaded “Boney,” for
many years a figure of terror to hundreds of
thousands of Englishmen, was brought captive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
on the <i>Bellerophon</i> into Tor Bay, to be revealed to
the gaping hundreds who put off in boats to see
him, as merely a little fat man, clean-shaven,
melancholy, and obviously unwell, mildly pacing
the quarter-deck, and saying unexpectedly complimentary
things about the scenery and the
climate.</p>

<p>Its inhabitants then numbered about fifteen
hundred, chiefly fishermen and the wives and
families of naval officers, who, anchoring from
time to time in the safe and roomy anchorage of
Tor Bay, had first “discovered” the place. It
was then still little more than that Quay at the
foot of the hills (or “Tors”) it had been when
William of Orange landed at Brixham, in 1688;
and the fine old residence of Tor Abbey, seat then
as now of the Carys, was the only considerable
place in the neighbourhood. The hill-tops were
yet in a state of nature, except the crest of Chapel
Hill, where the little chapel of St. Michael formed
a notable landmark for sailors. This was, according
to legend, the offering of some ancient
mariner, and displayed a beacon-light at night,
to guide shipping safely into the bay. The ancient
chapel, one of the smallest in England, measuring
only thirty-six feet in length, remains to this
day, two hundred and seventy feet above the sea,
at the modern suburb of Torre, and is part of the
borough meteorological station.</p>

<p class="caption">THE ANCIENT CHAPEL OF ST. MICHAEL, TORRE.</p>
</div>

<p>The Carys had so long been seated by the
shores of Tor Bay, in the halls of the discredited
and dispossessed monks, that they had lost all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
sense of the trend of affairs, and were utterly
unimaginative; and accordingly when in 1786
Sir Robert Palk, retiring wondrously enriched
from the governorship of Madras, and with an
£80,000 legacy into the bargain, purchased
Tormoham Manor, they made no attempt to
outbid him. To the changed times and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Palk family Torquay owes its growth. Tor Bay
had in all those bygone centuries been a lovely
solitude, for in the warlike ages, when fire and
sword swept even sheltered spots like Dartmouth,
snugly hidden behind a difficult entrance, an
open strand was too dangerous a place to settle
upon; but Sir Robert Palk early perceived
changed conditions and made his account with
them, and in due time his son, Sir Lawrence Palk,
succeeded him and built the first harbour. The
inevitable consequence of the Palk activities and
of the changed condition of affairs was that the
town of Torquay sprang into vigorous existence,
and the further and equally obvious consequence
of the Palks becoming great as ground-landlords
was that in the fulness of time they were raised
from baronets to be barons; Sir Lawrence
Hesketh Palk, fifth baronet, being in 1880, in his
thirty-fourth year, raised to the peerage as
Baron Haldon. I can quite distinctly hear gnashings
of teeth and imprecations at lost opportunities
from the direction of Tor Abbey, echoing down
the alleys of the years.</p>

<p>Torquay was built when the Italian villa
fashion prevailed in the land. It was a favourable
spot for such an experiment. Look back upon
those terraced and rock-girt hills from this kindly
distance of the harbour, and the Italianate
character of the scenery, in its brilliant colouring
and bold and picturesque outline, is obvious, and
from this remove quite a number of those villas
deceptively resemble in outline the marble palazzos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of Florence, of Venice or Bologna. But close at
hand they are no more Italian than an Italian
warehouse, which we all know to be a parabolic
description of an oil and colour shop.</p>

<p>And now Torquay has acquired a Mayor
and Corporation, with town arms and a crest
and the advertising motto, <i>Salus et Felicitas</i>, and
ought to <i>be</i> happy as well as healthful, as per
motto: even though that motto does, when
spoken, suggest “sailors and solicitors.” But
no! Torquay has since learned that these luxuries
are expensive; in the facts that while, when the
town was incorporated, in 1892, there were then
but twenty-one officials, whose salaries amounted
to £2,413, there are now thirty-nine, who draw
£5,495.</p>

<p>Presently there will be electric tramways
at Torquay! Conceive it, all ye who know the
town. Could there be anything more suicidal
than to introduce such hustling methods into
Lotos-land?</p>

<p>I observe that, according to a handbook
advertising the attractions of Torquay, while
its winters are mild, its summers are cool, and
that “the maximum mean annual temperature
is 56·7°, and the minimum 45°.” Also it appears
that “the thermometer in the shade seldom rises
to 70°.” I must, therefore, be mistaken in
supposing that in August I have frequently
observed it, in the Strand, and on the spot eloquently
known as “the Gridiron,” to be twenty
degrees higher, and the Lord only knows what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
phenomenal heights in the sun. Under the same
extraordinary illusion, yucca, bamboo, palms,
eucalyptus, and other tropical plants flourish in
the beautiful rock-walks along the Torbay road,
and the fuchsia grows in the likeness of trees.</p>

<p>There are many who think Torquay looks its
best on moonlit summer nights, when the lights
in hill-top villas seem to vie with the stars, and
the search-lights of naval leviathans in the bay
send inquisitive beams along the shore or, adventuring
higher, surprise fair maids in their
bedrooms and make them blush.</p>

<span class="smaller">BRIXHAM—LANDING OF WILLIAM OF ORANGE</span></h2>

<p>Along the curving shores you come, past Tor
Abbey Sands, Livermead, and the little red knob
of Corbyn’s Head, with a hole in the rock like
an eye, to Paignton. The reason for Paignton’s
modern existence as a populous seaside town
is found in its excellent sands and safe bathing,
Torquay itself lacking any but the most meagre
foreshore, and the tides coming up to its sea-walls.
The best feature of Paignton is, after all,
an extraneous thing: the lovely view from it
of Torquay. In the old days, when Paignton
was merely a village of cob-built and thatched
cottages, grouped at hazard round the large,
ancient and beautiful church, it must have
been well worthy an artist’s attention—but that
day was long since done, and Paignton is now
merely a modern town, built on a flat site, with a
conventional pier, public gardens, and band
stand, and a weird freak building on the edge of
the sands, known as Redcliffe Towers, or sometimes
as “Smith’s Folly”; the Colonel Smith
who built it many years ago apparently taking
as models for his eccentric residence the round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
tower of Windsor Castle and the would-be
Oriental monstrosities of the Pavilion at Brighton.
The result is that it looks a kind of poor relation
of both.</p>

<p>Being a good deal more recent than Torquay,
Paignton is not so stucco-smothered; and its
villas and the buildings of its very busy and
smart chief street are largely in brick and terra-cotta.</p>

<p>The exceptionally beautiful church, which,
however, is sadly hidden away amid these later
developments, is due to Paignton having been
the site of a Bishop’s palace. A few ruins only
of that palace remain, with a romantic-looking
tower, in which according to a picturesque legend,
Miles Coverdale translated the Bible.</p>

<p>At the secluded sands of Goodrington and
Elbury Cove, that look perhaps their best from
the trains that hurry by, the traveller bids farewell
to the red rocks of Devon, and comes into the
regions of limestone and slate. The way leads on
to Brixham: the railway itself proceeding to
Kingswear, opposite Dartmouth, and throwing
off at “Churston Junction” a little two-mile
branch to the heights above Brixham town.
All day and every day a short train shuttlecocks
those two miles, the engine pulling one way and
pushing another. If there be any three persons
better qualified above their fellows to speak of
monotony, they must surely be the engine-driver,
stoker, and guard of this train.</p>

<p>The little terminus, so high above the town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
smells like a fish-shop, for Brixham is pre-eminently
in Devon the place of fish, and great
trainloads go forth every day. You look astonishingly
down upon roof-tops from this place.</p>

<p class="caption">MILES COVERDALE’S TOWER, PAIGNTON.</p>
</div>

<p>Down there is Brixham, perched with seeming
precariousness along the steeply sloping sides
of the hills overlooking the pool that forms its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
crowded harbour. To those who have never
seen the fisher towns of Cornwall it is an amazing
place: those who know the Cornish coast realise
that this is the first of the true West Country
fishing harbours, and it seems to them to have
strayed over into Devon by mistake. To speak
by the card, the “Brixham” of modern speech
is strictly “Brixham Quay,” and Higher Brixham,
away up-along, on the high table-land, is the real
original Brixham; but Brixham Quay long since
supplanted the original place in importance. It
is by far the largest and busiest fishing-port in
Devon, and as different from Torquay in character
as chalk proverbially is from cheese, marching-boots
from patent-leathers, salt from sugar, or
any other picturesque and striking antithesis
you can think of. In Torquay you commonly
hear Brixham spoken of as a “dirty, stinking
hole” and by similar terms, the reverse of endearing,
but while we may not deny it to be that,
it is that and something more. It is natural, and
characteristic of the real old seafaring and fishing
life of this coast, and Torquay, however delightful,
is not. Torquay and all “seaside resorts” are
excrescences, and utterly uncharacteristic of the
real indigenous life. No artist would choose to
paint or sketch Torquay and its delightful but
pictorially impossible villas, and smart but artistically
desolating visitors; but Brixham is an
artistic paradise. It is dirty but natural, smelly
but picturesque at every turn. An excellent
opportunity offers here, had we the leisure, for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
philosophic disquisition on the delightfully picturesque
qualities of dirt and untidiness, and the
negation, artistically, of order and sanitation.
Because of its wallowing in fish-offal and its
generally rough-and-ready ways, Brixham is no
place for the visitor, as generally understood;
but artists rejoice in it and its ways.</p>

<p>It must by no means be understood that the
houses of Brixham are picturesque. They are
nothing of the kind, being simply gaunt, stark
unlovely structures of cob, or stone, or lath and
plaster, as the case may be, generally stuccoed
and slate-roofed; with a resultant effect of greyness.
But they are arrayed in such amazing
tiers of terraces, one above the other, and are
huddled so nearly together, and hang so closely
over the harbour that the general effect is highly
picturesque.</p>

<p>Brixham changes little, and appears to be
very much as P. H. Gosse, visiting it in 1853,
found it; “close, mean and dirty,” with “refinements
of filth” which he had never seen
paralleled. One feels quite sorry for that distinguished
naturalist; but on the shore, at low
water, under the stones, he found <i>Trochus ziziphinus</i>
numerously, which seems to have been
some consolation. One feels irresistibly tempted
to suggest that, had he stayed at Brixham the
night, he might also have found <i>pulex irritans</i>, at
the least of it, which would not have been so
satisfactory.</p>

<p>It was to this fishy place that William, Prince of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Orange, came on November 5th, 1688, intent upon
saving the liberties of England from extinction
at the hands of his bigoted father-in-law, James
the Second. The “Protestant Deliverer” came
invited and welcomed by the majority of Englishmen,
for the country was so shiftless that it
could not make out to save itself; and, because of
the mutual jealousies that would have forbidden
the success of any rising headed by one of our
own, must needs call in the cold, silent Dutchman,
whom none loved. One’s sympathies are distinctly
with the debonnair Duke of Monmouth,
whose rebellion had ended so disastrously, three
years earlier.</p>

<p>The Hollander preparations for this invasion
were great, and spread over a considerable period
of time; and there was, moreover, no secret made
of them. The flotilla gathered together for the
enterprise consisted of fifty men-o’-war, and over
five hundred transports, carrying an army of
fourteen thousand men. It was thus not very much
the inferior in strength to that of the great Armada
itself. It waited long in the harbour of Helvoetsluys,
attendant upon the wind, which had been
blowing steadily in an unfavourable direction.
At last, October 16th, it changed from west to east,
and the hour seemed to have come. The prince
took leave of the States-General, which wept
copiously over him; while he remained, as was
his wont, grave and phlegmatic, only recommending
the princess to their care, should anything
happen to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>The great fleet sailed on the 19th, but the next
day the wind changed to north, and then worked
round with violent gales from the west, so that,
in distress, they were obliged to put back to port.
No vessels were lost, and only one man was
drowned, but five hundred horses died.</p>

<p>The States at once gave orders for the replenishing
of all stores, the princess, for her part,
ordered prayers four times daily, and at last,
on the evening of November 1st, the fleet again
put forth, with an east wind. The original idea
was to have landed in the mouth of the Humber,
and it must have seemed, to many of the Englishmen
who accompanied the expedition, an ill-omen
that they were carried down channel into that
identical West Country which had proved so fatal
to Monmouth.</p>

<p>The English fleet was assembled, watchful,
at the mouth of the Thames, but unable, in the
teeth of the east wind, to emerge; and saw, with
helplessness, the great concourse of ships go, full
sail, down channel. Despite the fears of those
who looked upon the west as ominous of ill, the
elements were thus working for the success of
William, who thus, unchallenged, arrived off the
coast of Devon. Arrived there, the more timorous
began to fear being carried too far west to Plymouth,
or beyond, from which the intended
march to the capital, along the heavy roads of
autumn, would be a toilsome and hazardous
undertaking.</p>

<p>But all things made for success, and, arrived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Torbay on the night of November 4th, the easterly
wind ceased and changed to soft breezes from
the south. The next morning the landing began,
in this harbour of Brixham. It was November 5th,
the auspicious anniversary of the famous failure
of the Popish “Gunpowder Treason and Plot,”
and the bells of Brixham rang out joyously, to
celebrate History made, and History in the making.</p>

<p class="caption">OBELISK MARKING THE SPOT WHERE WILLIAM OF ORANGE LANDED.</p>
</div>

<p>Brixham Quay was then just a quay, and
little else. The crowded houses of this later age
were represented only by a few scattered fish-cellars
and sheds, and in place of the stone piers
and artificial harbour we now see was merely a
pool formed by nature, unassisted by art.</p>

<p>Many legends of this landing survive at
Brixham. One tells how the prince, standing
in the boat that brought him towards the shore,
exclaimed in the best English he could command,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
to the people who crowded the quay, “Mine goot
beoble, I mean you goot, I am come here for your
goot—for all your goots”; but I think that is
suspiciously like one of the famous Ben Trovato’s
stories, and it certainly has been told of other
aliens coming to these shores. The legends then
go on to tell how the prince asked if he were
welcome, and being assured of the fact replied
that, if he were really welcome, they should come
and fetch him; which means no more than that
there were then no stairs to the water, and that, if
a fine gentleman wished to land dry and clean,
he must needs be carried ashore.</p>

<p>One Peter Varwell, a fisherman, described as
a short, thick-set little man, then jumped into
the water and carried the Deliverer to land. We
are not told how the Duke of Schomberg and
Bishop Burnet, among other great ones, came
ashore; I am afraid they had to hoof it through
the water and the fish-offal. But when Burnet
<i>did</i> set foot upon the quay, the prince, turning
to him and taking his hand, asked if he did not
believe now, more than ever, in predestination.
This was by way of a gentle rebuke to that distinguished
Churchman’s want of faith during
the preparations for the expedition, when at
every mischance he had dejectedly said the enterprise
seemed to be predestined to failure.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">LANDING OF WILLIAM OF ORANGE</span></h2>

<p>The landing was completed in three hours, without
a hitch and was followed by divine service on
the beach, concluded by all the troops singing
the 118th Psalm, which is at once a psalm of
thanksgiving for mercies received, and a bidding
for others. Reading it, you conceive the Psalmist
as timorously thankful, buoyed up by faith to
a certain degree, and yet horribly frightened;
and thus, there can be no doubt, it was highly
appropriate to the situation in which all at that
moment found themselves. We may, perhaps,
suspect that the eighth verse, which deprecates
confidence being put in princes, was omitted for
this occasion.</p>

<p>An absurd story tells us that the inhabitants
of Brixham (or “Broxholme,” as the Dutch called
it), presented an address to the prince, in this
form:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“And please your majesty, King William,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">You’re welcome to Brixham Quay,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">To eat buckhorn, and drink bohea</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Along with we</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And please your majesty, King William.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>The individually quite sufficient objections to
this are that the prince was not yet acknowledged
king, and that tea was then unknown at Brixham;
and in any case, it would have been an expensive
luxury far beyond the reach of fisherfolk. What
“buckhorn” may have been is a mystery not
revealed to the present generation.</p>

<p>The place was thronged that day and night
with the expeditionary force, and the landlord
of the one inn that then sufficed for the thirst
of the whole community—it was probably the
“Buller’s Arms,” quite recently rebuilt—was,
according to the diarist who recorded all these
things, so puffed up with the honour of serving
so many lords that he almost imagined himself
to be one.</p>

<p>William himself was lodged in the house, still
standing in Middle Street, the home of the little
man, Varwell, who afterwards marched with the
army on to Exeter, and was promised a reward
for his services. Unhappy Varwell! He went
later, to London, and fell to gossiping with
strangers in a tavern, with the result that they
drugged him and sent one of their confederates
to Whitehall to claim the promised recompense.
He was paid a hundred guineas, and when the
real Varwell put in an appearance, he was not
only sent empty away, but received a good
thrashing as well.</p>

<p class="caption">THE HOUSE WHERE WILLIAM OF ORANGE SLEPT.</p>
</div>

<p>William’s army, having camped in the fields
overnight, marched from Brixham about noon
on November 6th, in very rainy weather and along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
bad roads. They made but four miles that day,
and halted the night at Paignton, where tradition
says William slept at the “Crown and Sceptre,”
within sight of that old red sandstone tower in
which, according to another tradition, Miles
Coverdale, Bishop of Exeter, another sturdy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Protestant protagonist, had translated the
Bible.</p>

<p>Meanwhile William had been receiving assurances
of support from influential personages.
Nicholas Roope, of Dartmouth, was the first
considerable person to join him. But others
exhibited a not unnatural timidity and caution.
Memories of the ferocious revenge taken upon
the sympathisers with Monmouth, three years
earlier, were keen, and the influential and the
great did their negotiation as secretly as might
be. That is why records of those early days are
so scarce and traditions are our only resort.</p>

<p>The greatest and the proudest personage then
in the neighbourhood of Brixham was Sir Edward
Seymour, of Berry Pomeroy Castle. He it was
who, when William asked if he were not of the
family of the Duke of Somerset, replied: “Pardon
me, the Duke of Somerset is of my family.” There
you see the head of the original stock venting his
spleen on the younger branch of the Seymours,
upon whom the accident of fate had bestowed a
proud title, while the elder was fobbed off with a
mere knighthood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Edward joined the Prince of Orange at
Exeter, when it was tolerably clear to most people
that the cause of James was lost; but when the
Prince was but newly landed, that cautious Sir
Edward, and a number of equally cautious
gentlemen with him, met him secretly at Aish,
a lonely, out-of-the-way hamlet between Brixham
and Totnes, to discuss the support to be given.
The cottage where they met is still standing, and
is called “Parliament House,” while all the
country-folk know the road to it by the name of
“Parliament Lane.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>That caution was very noticeable, all the way
to Exeter. When William came to Newton
Abbot, and stayed at Ford House two nights,
Sir William Courtenay, the owner, although he
left directions that the prince was to be hospitably
entertained, found it convenient to be elsewhere
on urgent business that would brook no delay,
and when the clergyman at Newton handed over
the keys of the church, in order that the bells
might be rung in honour of the proclamation in
the market-place, of the Prince as King William
the Third, he made it clear, <i>pro formâ</i>, that he
only relinquished those keys on compulsion.</p>

<p>There is some curious food for the whimsical
mind in the fact that the Prince of Orange should
have crossed the river Lemon, on his way past
Newton Abbot; and there is ample room for
criticism of the inscription on the famous Proclamation
Stone in Newton Abbot market-place,
in which it is stated that the Rev. John Reynell
proclaimed the Protestant Deliverer there,
November 5th. Reynell—the clergyman who was
so cautious as to hand over the keys of the church
only “on compulsion”—was not a man rash
enough to proclaim any king who might presently
become a fugitive, and thereby possibly find himself
arraigned before the ferocious Jeffreys. No:
Reynell did not proclaim the new king. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
probably Dr. Burnet—who accompanied the expedition—who
did so, and certainly not before
November 7th. Meanwhile, we will leave William
to march on to Exeter and thence to London,
where he arrived December 18th.</p>

<p>The stone on which William’s foot rested on his
landing has been jealously preserved, but it has
been moved about overmuch. The landing was
on the site of the present fishmarket, and there
the obelisk partly enclosing the stone was first
erected; but when another William—the Duke
of Clarence, afterwards William the Fourth—came
ashore at Brixham in 1828, it was removed
to its present position, on what was then called
the New Quay. The weird passion for utility
that characterises Englishmen, and has spoiled
so many monuments, has caused this obelisk to
be crowned with a gas-lamp.</p>

<p>It was left to modern times to fitly commemorate
this great event in our history, for
on the two hundredth anniversary the marble
statue of the king that now forms so striking a
feature of the harbour was erected. He is
represented at the moment of his stepping ashore
and, hand to heart, declaring, “The liberties of
England and the Protestant religion I will maintain.”</p>

<p>Those who gaze upon the statue and pronounce
the face of it ugly forget that William was not
handsome. He was consumptive, asthmatic and
hollow-cheeked, and the sculptors have rendered
him, not idealistically, but as he was, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
very necessary reservation that he is here of heroic
size, while in life he was small and undersized.</p>

<p>For the rest there are few records at Brixham
of the coming of William of Orange. No blood
was shed there, and the only note of that stirring
time to be found in the parish registers is the
pathetic burial entry: “1688, November 21, a
foreigner belonging to the Prenz of Oringe,” with
another entry of the same date referring to the
same person being buried in woollen: “a Dutch
man, cujus nomen ignotum.” He was probably
some humble follower, who fell sick aboard, and
so died on the threshold of this land flowing with
milk and honey, in which so many of his fellow
mynheers flourished so well.</p>

<p>The <i>Brill</i>, the vessel on which William came
to England, had a strange after-history. She
was re-christened <i>Princess Mary</i>, and converted
into a yacht. So she remained through the reign
of Queen Anne; but when the Hanoverian line
began, and sentiment was cut off at the main, she
was sold to some London merchants, who re-christened
her the <i>Betsy Cairns</i> and sent her
trading to the West Indies. From that condition
the poor old vessel declined to that of a collier,
and so continued for an incredible number of
years, being wrecked on the Black Middens, off
Tynemouth, in quite recent times.</p>

<span class="smaller">BRIXHAM—THE FISHERY—ROUND THE COAST TO
DARTMOUTH</span></h2>

<p>The statue of Dutch William makes the background
of Brixham Harbour picturesque, and the
fishing-fleet and the houses climbing up, tier above
tier, confer a nobility upon the statue: they
re-act upon one another, in short, in a most
admirably pictorial way. There are over three
hundred vessels in the trawling fleet of Brixham,
and all are sailing-boats. The largest, known
technically as “dandies,” are of fifty tons burthen,
and cost about £1,000. The intermediate, and
most numerous class are “bumble-bees,” and
the smallest are merely “hookers,” “hukers,” in
the Devon inflection, of twenty-five tons. The
cost of a “bumble-bee” is £450. It carries a
crew of three men, who work according to the
custom of the Brixham fishery, on rarely changing
lines. Brixham, unlike the great fishing port of
Grimsby, where steam-trawling and highly costly
vessels owned by corporations are the rule,
conducts its industry on more individual and
joint-stock lines. Here we find the captain and
the owner usually one and the same person, working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
with his two men on the partnership principle.
He is, of course, by virtue of his ownership a
capitalist in his way, and for the purpose of getting
a return for his venture, as well as for his labour,
the shares of the boat are divided into five parts,
of which he takes three; one for self, one for the
boat, and one for the nets and general gear, leaving
one each for the crew, who contribute only their
labour. The takings are divided every week,
and, like the fortunes of war, they vary extravagantly.</p>

<p>If you conceive a bag forty to fifty feet in
length, you will have some approximate notion
of the size of a trawl-net. The mouth of it is
stretched wide apart by a pole like a builder’s
scaffold-pole, heavily shod at each end with iron,
for the purpose of weighing down the mouth of
the net as it is drawn, or “trawled,” along the
bottom of the sea. Sailing out of harbour, the
trawl-net is “shot” the length of some seventy
fathoms, necessary to reach the bottom of the
fishing-grounds in Torbay, and thus, going with
the wind for six to eight hours, the smacks drag
their exaggerated bags along the bed of ocean,
scooping up whatever lies in the way. It may
thus justly be supposed that the bed of Torbay is a
pretty well-swept floor.</p>

<p>It is a comparatively easy thing to shoot a
trawl-net, but a long and laborious job for two
men, straining at the winch, to wind it aboard
again, with its load of fish, often very largely useless.
So soon as the hauling up of the nets begins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
myriads of sea-gulls, springing apparently from
nowhere in particular, appear, with the instantaneous
promptitude of a crowd in a quiet street of
London when an accident has happened. Screaming
and circling about, dipping instantaneously
into the water, and rising up quickly, they often
make daring snatches at the fish aboard. Surely
there is nothing so sharp-eyed on earth, in air,
or water, as a sea-gull, and nothing so greedy
and insatiable. The sea-gull is the scavenger of
the fisher towns and villages, and is not nice in
his tastes. Nothing comes amiss to his hungry
maw, from fresh fish down to stale, ancient enough
to be a very monument of offence and a something
beyond the worst experiences of a sanitary inspector;
and the dead kittens and rats of the
seaside communities form welcome side-dishes.</p>

<p>The gulls’ turn, however, comes when the
sorting of the nets begins. When the useless dog-fish
are flung overboard they struggle and guzzle
their fill: for, unfortunately for the fisherfolk,
the dog-fish are never lacking, although the
saleable fish may be often sadly to seek. But
now dog-fish are often marketed as “flake.” The
catch is generally a miscellaneous one of turbot,
bream, plaice, whiting, hake, haddock, gurnet,
sole, and brill, with a few lobsters, crabs, and eels,
and when the undesirables among the fish, and the
stones and the seaweed, are sorted out, frequently
resolves itself into a dozen or so pair of soles, and
a few baskets and “trunks” of other fish. The
aristocracy of the catch are, of course, the turbot
and the soles, but when a bad day’s trawling and
a day of poor market prices come together, the
day’s labour for three men may not bring the
skipper more than twelve shillings and his two
men four shillings apiece.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>The fish is sold by auction in the long-roofed
but open-sided shed that runs the whole length
of the harbour, and the auctioneers settle weekly
with the skippers, after deducting their commission,
the market-dues, and the earnings of the lumpers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
as the fish-porters who carry the catches from
the smack to the market are called. Rougher,
more rugged, ragged, or more quaintly dressed
and bearded men than those of the Brixham
trawling fleet, and those others who attend the
auctions, it would be difficult to find; but many
among them are of the famous “Brixham lords.”
A “Brixham lord” is the product at a considerable
distance of time, of the vicissitudes of the old
lords of the manor of Brixham. That manor,
passing from the Novants and the Valletorts, and
coming eventually to the Bonviles, was at length
divided into quarters, of which one quarter came
to the Gilberts, from whom it was purchased by
what in these financial days we should term a
“syndicate” of twelve fishermen. In the course
of many generations and the natural subdivision
of property, those original twelve shares of that
quarter have been so apportioned that the “lords”
of Brixham, owning infinitesimal portions of the
manor, are a very large crowd indeed. Some of
them, too, are “ladies.” The saying of Brixham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
is therefore easily credible, that there are more
lords of the manor in it than in any other town
in England.</p>

<p>A pathetic literary interest belongs to Brixham,
for it was here that the Rev. Henry Francis
Lyte was vicar for twenty-five years. He died
at Naples, whither he had gone to seek health,
in his fifty-fourth year. One last evening, before
he left Brixham for ever, as he knew it must be,
he prayed that he might be allowed to write
something by which the memory of him might be
kept green to all time, and, returning from the
fisher-town as sun was setting, to Berry Head
House, conceived and wrote that best-known of
hymns, “Abide with Me.” In the widespread
favour it immediately obtained, and in the vogue
it must ever retain while hymns last, his prayer
was answered. It is a beautiful hymn, but a
thing of tears, depression, and hopelessness, that
leaves you a great deal worse, and a great deal
more self-pitying, than before indulging in it.
As well might one suggest sitting in a draught as
the remedy for a cold, as hope to revive the
spirits on “Abide with Me.” It is beautiful, but
for my part, I want something more uplifting and
robustious, and would rather go forth and do
battle with blue-devils and kick stumbling-blocks
out of the way, and keep a stout heart to the
ultimate breath, on some swashbuckling Hew-Agag-in-Pieces-before-the-Lord
psalmody, than
dissolve in tears on the minor key of “Abide with
Me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Berry Head is a kind of natural barrier, or
unsurmountable wall, to the Brixham people.
You will readily understand why it should be
so, if you seek to walk round to Kingswear by
the coast. It is so, not so much by reason of the
steepness and ruggedness of the way, for the
road out of Brixham, up-along to the railway-station
and so on to Churston Ferrers, is equally
heart-breaking, but there are all manner of
occasions for going in <i>that</i> direction; while few
have any business, or pleasure either, over Berry
Head, or along that lonely and rugged coast, save
some poor fool of an exploring tourist who, encountering
rain on these shelterless coastguard
walks, is fain to think, like the Melancholy Jaques
in Arden, that when he was at home, he was in a
better place. Hence the peculiar appositeness
of the Brixham synonym for death, “going round
the Head,” as it were into the Unknown. “Bless
’ee! ’er’s bin gone round the Head these dree
months” was the reply to an inquiry after one
recently dead.</p>

<p>Primed with all this knowledge, it is scarcely
with uplifted heart that the explorer scales these
minatory heights. On the way to the Head the
road looks down upon the incomplete breakwater,
begun in 1843 and abandoned when 1,300 feet
of it had been built and £21,000 expended.
Across the bay lies Torquay, glorious in the
sunshine; behind us is the end of the world, as
it seems—the gorsy plateau of the Head, with a
forlorn refreshment house among the ruins of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
live forts erected during the Napoleonic scare,
themselves built amid the walls and earthworks
of the Romans, constructed some 1850 years ago.
Here is the Ash Hole, a cavern where the soldiers
of the early nineteenth century flung the bones
and broken pottery and domestic refuse of their
barracks on the top of a similar deposit made by
the Roman soldiery of the first century of our
era. And beneath the potsherds of the Romans
is stalagmite, and beneath <i>that</i> again the bones
of animals extinct aeons before Rome began.
Ugh!</p>

<p>From hence it is an easy walk to the sheer
edge of this great mass of pink limestone, which
drops perpendicularly down into deep water.
Round the point, the cliffs grow darker and more
jagged, with the Cod Rock and Mewstone out in
the sea and Durl Head, splashed pink and
black, marked by a deserted iron mine.</p>

<p>Durl Head looks across to Mudstone Sands,
not really muddy, and Sharkham Point. Inland,
in between them, is Windmill Hill, with its
celebrated cave, sharing the prehistoric honours
of Kent’s Cavern. No visitor to Brixham who
arrives by steamboat is likely to be left in ignorance
of “Philp’s Cave,” for handbills extolling the
glories of it are plentifully distributed at such
times.</p>

<p>Philp was a dyer who in 1857 determined to
leave his dyeing and go in for quarrying, and to
this end purchased a plot of land here of the Commissioners
for the enclosure of Waste Lands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
He soon got to work, and in the following January
the cave “discovered” itself by engulfing a
quarrying tool that Philp in person was using.
He explored the place and found it to be a tunnel
running fifty feet into the hill, with a further
gallery at the end, in another direction. Stalagmite
made a continuous covering on the floor,
and from it projected bones which scientific men
who soon flocked to the spot proclaimed to be
those of reindeer and cave-bears. Among them
were the flint implements of prehistoric man, who
seems never to have returned for them, for his
bones are not among the remains. Perhaps one
of the hyænas of Kent’s Cavern cut him off,
untimely.</p>

<p>I think the ten miles (for it is not an inch less)
round from Mudstone Bay to Kingswear is the
loneliest, and the most scrambly and tiring,
coast climb in South Devon. Rocks succeed
sands, and sands follow rocks; headlands alternating
with bays, and ups with downs. Now
you face west, now south, then something betwixt
and between; and if you don’t quite box
the compass, you do so very nearly. Every
coombe, every headland, has a name, but they
are all of a likeness: Sharkham Point, Southdown
Head, Man Sands, Crab Rock Point, Long
Sands, Scabbacombe Sands, Down Head, Ivy
Cove, Pudcombe Cove, Kelly’s Cove, and Froward
Point. Not a soul will you see, not a house, save
the coastguards and their station and cottages at
Man Sands. And this is overcrowded England!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Off Froward Point, black and splintered and
well-named, is yet another Mewstone, with a
companion, the Cat Stone; and the Black Rock
some distance out. From here we turn gradually
round and come by Mill Bay, under the tall white
day-mark on the hill-top, to Kingswear Castle.</p>

<span class="smaller">DARTMOUTH</span></h2>

<p>The cheapest ferry in England is that which
takes you across from Kingswear to Dartmouth.
In point of fact, there are two: the pontoon-like
affair that plies from the ferry-slip, and the
Great Western Railway’s steamer, conveying
passengers between Kingswear station and Dartmouth
Quay. The fare for one person is merely
a humble halfpenny.</p>

<p>It is a romantic way of entering Dartmouth,
which lies across there, down by the water’s edge,
with great hills rising in the background, and
the smoke from Dartmouth’s thousand chimneys
ascending visibly, like some great incense-offering.
From this point of view you perceive the essential
justness of that ancient foreigner’s report when,
sent to spy upon the chances of surprising
Dartmouth, he declared that the hills were its
walls.</p>

<p>And the story of Dartmouth is one of raids,
made and suffered, alternately. The kingdoms
of England and of France might be at peace, but
the ports on either side of the Channel were often
engaged in their own private wars, and sent ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and men out to burn, pillage, and slay; while
between the English seaman and the Spaniard
there existed an enmity which neither treaties nor
prudence could set at rest. The gallant seaman
of the age of romance, whether Frenchman,
Spaniard, or Englishman, was nothing less than
a corsair: a murdering scoundrel who, if he
could appear in person at this day before his
eulogists, would be the most unwelcome of visitors
from the great and glorious past. His only recommendation
is his undoubted courage and his
exclusive patriotism. The English sea-captains
of Queen Elizabeth’s day had no more doubt
of being God’s avengers against the Spaniard than
they had of the sun’s setting in the west; and—although
we do not hear so much of the views
entertained by the other side—the foreigners
doubtless held equally bigoted opinions. The
merchant-adventurers of Dartmouth, such as
the Hawleys and the Roopes, whose monumental
brasses may to this day be found in the ancient
churches of St. Saviour in the town, and St.
Petrox at the Castle, were embattled traders,
whose captains knew what was expected of them,
and accordingly did not merely trade peacefully
to foreign parts, but beat about the seas in the
hope of snapping up rich prizes; whether in time
of peace or war mattered little or nothing. Their
piety and their ferocity were equally remarkable,
and they could find it easily possible to slit a
throat, or to make a whole ship’s company walk
the plank, to the tune of a thanksgiving psalm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
It was a remarkable combination of good qualities
and defects, but after all not more remarkable
than the doings of such modern people as Rockefeller
in America—who will, by illegitimate trading
and systematic lying, ruin thousands while posing
before a Sunday School—and of his fellows in
England, whose names the law of libel will not
permit of being printed.</p>

<p>The daring seamanship and the unscrupulous
methods of Hawley’s captains, little better than
pirates, enriched Hawley immensely, and the
like may be said of the Roopes and others. At
times of national emergency Hawley could, with
an ease readily to be understood, lend his ships
entirely for warlike purposes, and probably his
crews did not find the change from their “mercantile”
voyages very striking. In 1390, for
example, as the chronicler Stow informs us, his
flotilla “took thirty-four shippes laden with
wyne to the sum of fifteen hundred tunnes.” It
was probably of one of Hawley’s captains that
Chaucer was thinking when he described the
“shipman of Dartmouth,” one of the Canterbury
Pilgrims setting out from Southwark in 1383.
This shipman, at any rate, had need of pilgrimage,
or some drastic purging course for the remission
of sins, for he is described as having sent many
“home by water”; a polite way of saying that
he had murdered many upon the high seas by
making them walk the plank overboard.</p>

<p>The great John Hawley is represented in
effigy on the floor of St. Saviour’s church. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
died full of years and honours in 1480, and his
two wives, Joan and Alice, are represented beside
him. He looks a substantial and honest
merchant, a benevolent
burgess, and everything
respectable and right worshipful,
as though piracy
were a word that had
no meaning for him. The
interior of St. Saviour’s
is further remarkable for
the Elizabethan gallery,
panelled and elaborately
ornate with the heraldic
shields of other old legalised
pirates of the
town, and for its beautiful
early sixteenth-century
pulpit of most ornately
carved, painted and gilt
stone: one of some eight
or ten such pulpits in
wood or stone to be found
in the surrounding districts,
and nowhere else
in England. The extraordinary
boldness, wealth, and high relief of
the carving single these remarkable pulpits
out from anything else in the country; and
their gilding, their vivid red, blue, and green
colouring, give them a gorgeous and almost
barbaric effect.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Probably as a direct result of the piratical
doings of the Dartmouth people, inviting reprisals,
it was in 1481 considered advisable to further
strengthen the defences of the narrow entrance
to Dartmouth harbour; and the existing fortifications
on either side were built. The people of
Dartmouth were clever enough to get this done at
the expense of the nation, the king agreeing to pay
the cost, to the extent of £30 a year, out of the
customs of Dartmouth and Exeter. The “stronge
and myghtye and defensyve new tower” then
agreed upon to be built is the existing castle. A
chain was to be stretched across between this and
Kingswear every night, and although this has,
of course, disappeared, the places whence it was
stretched are still to be seen.</p>

<p>Dartmouth as a port of call for liners died
hard, but the last line of steamships, the Donald
Currie service to the Cape, went, and now it is
divided between being a favourite yachting station
and the home of the new Royal Naval College,
which, transferred from its picturesque and makeshift
old home aboard the <i>Britannia</i> and <i>Hindostan</i>,
now crowns the hill and nobly dominates the whole
of Dartmouth in the great range of buildings overlooking
the Dart.</p>

<p>The ferryman who puts us across the Dart is
full of information and as full of regrets about the
<i>Britannia</i> and <i>Hindostan</i>, the new Naval College,
and the changed conditions of seafaring life, but
with a sardonic smile he thinks the cadets will
learn their business as well ashore as they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
done afloat. “Why not?” he asks. “They
don’t want no sailors nowadays. There <i>was</i> a
time when a sailor was never without his marline-spike
an’ mallet. Now they’re all bloody
Dagoes and Dutchies in the merchant sarvice,
an’ engineers and stoke-hole men, with cold
chisels, ’stead of knives, in the Navy. For a
sailor—when there <i>were</i> sailors, mind you—to
be without his knife, why, he might every bit
as well up’n give his cap’n a clump auver th’yed,
so he might. An’ up <i>there</i>—” he jerked so contemptuous
a thumb over his shoulder that it was
almost a wonder the new flagstaff on the new
central tower did not wilt—“up <i>there</i> them
young juicers is fed up with ’lectricity ’n things
no Godfearing sailorman in <i>my</i> time never
heerd of.”</p>

<p>Although it is designed in the Paltry Picturesque
Eclectic Renaissance or Doll’s House, style
with ornamental fripperies and fandangalums
galore, the Naval College has the noblest of
aspects, seen from down the harbour, or across
the Dart, from Old Rock Ferry. Planted on
the wooded summit of Mount Boone, the long
range of buildings, backed by dark trees, sets
just that crown and finish upon Dartmouth which
suffices to raise the scenic character of the place
from beauty to nobility. A curious feature of it
is the clock in the central tower, which rings seafaring
time ashore: so many “bells.” At sea
the twelve hours are divided into three watches of
four hours each, with a “bell” to every half-hour.
Thus the “bells” rise with the half-hours to
eight, when they begin again, with the completion
of the first half-hour of the new watch. In this
manner, the “bells” agree with shoregoing chimes
only twice a day: at eight o’clock, morning and
night.</p>

<p>The parish church of Dartmouth, oddly enough,
is neither St. Saviour’s in the town, nor St. Petrox
at the castle, but St. Clement’s at Townstal, on
the hilltop, quite a mile distant. Many of the
very old and very fine fifteenth and sixteenth
century overhanging and gabled houses have in
modern times been destroyed, some by fire and
some in wanton “improvements”; but Foss
Street, looking along to St. Saviour’s, shows what
old Dartmouth was like. There are found ancient
houses with windows bracketed out upon strikingly
artistic Renaissance carvings of lions and unicorns;
but the houses in that street are decrepit, and
the Butter Walk undoubtedly shows the best
preserved old architecture. When we consider
that Dartmouth was once, as a whole, like
this, it will sadly be realised how grievous the
change.</p>

<p>Dartmouth to-day is still a very busy place,
and full of slummy little alleys, and extraordinarily
swarming with children. Amid all this
crowding and bustle of business there are always
plenty of loafers to lean over breast-high walls,
contemplating the picturesque scene, where houses
crowd and cling to the very water’s edge, and old,
half-forgotten waterside towers stand, silent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
reminders of a bygone need for watchfulness. At
Bayard’s Cove in especial, the coal-lumpers, the
boatmen, and the generally idle sit on the quay
walls in the sun, or lean against them, keeping
them up. The coal-lumpers work perhaps sixteen
or twenty hours at a stretch, coaling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
steamers that come into port, and then want no

groan if by chance they see another job coming

<span class="smaller">THE DART—DITTISHAM—STOKE GABRIEL—“PARLIAMENT
HOUSE”</span></h2>

<p>The eight miles steamboat trip up or down the
Dart is one of the finest things Devonshire has
to show, for the river Dart is rightly thought
the most beautiful of rivers. The Dart chiefly
known in this manner by tourists is not the
mountain-stream that rises in the heart of Dartmoor,
but the tidal, salt-water estuary between
Dartmouth and Totnes. Not only tourists, but
all who have business between those two places,
use the Dart and its steamers; for the district,
hilly as it is, knows nothing of railways. The
Dart is known well enough by tourists from the
decks of these little steamers, but its shores and
creeks, and the quiet villages along them, are
rarely explored. The picturesque village of Dittisham
is perhaps an exception, for the steamers
call off its quay, and picnic parties penetrate so
far. Dittisham is a large village occupying a
rather puzzling geographical position on one of
the numerous capes or headlands formed by the
amazing windings of this romantic river. It
looks upon the water from two directly opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
outlooks, and is partly the home of salmon-fishers,
builders of fishing-smacks, and, in these
latter days, a sprinkling of independent “residential”
people, who enjoy the “quiet life.” A
little row of white-washed and pink-washed and
blue-washed houses faces upon a quay, and the
“Passage House” inn marks where the boat plies
across to Greenaway; but apart from this quayside
there is scarce a level square yard of ground
in Dittisham, whose lanes, bordered for the most
part by old, heavily thatched cottages and gardens,
where flowers and shrubs grow in prodigal luxuriance,
are steep and stony in the extreme.
Dittisham is always beautiful, but especially lovely
in spring, when the surrounding orchards are in
blossom: particularly the damson orchards, for
which the place is locally famous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>A great deal of the supreme beauty of the
Dart is due to the dense woods that cover the
bold hillsides of either shore and are reflected with
solemn loveliness in the tide. The Anchor Rock,
prominent in mid-stream, lends its more or less
authentic story to guide-book students, for legend
tells us that the scolding wives of the community
were landed upon it and given ample leisure to
repent; although the very name of this solitary
crag would lead the student to suppose that it was
originally the spot whereon some early hermit,
or anchorite, voluntarily secluded himself.</p>

<p>By crossing the river to Greenaway, and
walking through woods and across meadows, the
explorer comes, in a scrambly way, to a place very
rarely seen by fleeting tourists. This is Galmpton—or
“Gaamton” as the Devonshire folk call
it—hidden away in a lakelike creek. Here the
stranger finds an unexpected scene of industry,
for in this nook, where the tide lazily rolls up and
as lazily slides down, with the ooze and scum, and
chance leaves and twigs voyaging back and forth,
is a busy shipbuilding yard.</p>

<p>They do not build ocean liners at Galmpton,
but they have had for some seventy years past
a very fine steady business in the building of
trawlers for the Brixham and Lowestoft fisheries;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and sometimes a smart sailing yacht leaves
these sheds. Here, for example, as I write, a
teak-built yacht of one hundred tons, to cost
£4000 is on the stocks, and will leave Galmpton
fully rigged. The average output of this yard
is twelve trawlers a year, and it gives employment
to between sixty and seventy men, who live mostly
at Dittisham, taking boat to and from work each
morning and evening.</p>

<p>Aish, that spot historic in connection with the
landing of the Protestant Defender in 1688, is
not so easily discovered by the stranger
in these gates, and its very remoteness
was its chief recommendation in the
times when it became historic. It is
reached most easily by breaking the
steamboat trip up the Dart at Duncannon
Quay, which is also the landing-place
for Stoke Gabriel, tucked away in
its own shy creek. Stoke Gabriel is the
least visited and most primitive place on the Dart,
and headquarters of the salmon-fishery; as the
nets, drying on long poles, and the strange jerseyed
and booted figures of the fisherfolk proclaim.
With every tide the salt water comes to fill the
picturesque creek of Stoke Gabriel and to make
a mirror for the woods to view their own loveliness,
and with every ebb it flows out again in a murmuring
cascade over the rude weir built of mossy
boulders. It hushes the children of the village
to sleep at night, and fills the ears on summer
days with a lazy purr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a good deal of Stoke Gabriel when you
come to know it well. Particularly pretty is the
little street of cottages leading up to the church,
where the “Church House Inn” by its sign seems
to indicate that it was originally one of those
houses provided by the church for the accommodation
of parishioners coming from some
distance to attend service. Such houses were
often kept by the parish clerk, who brewed the
“church ales.” In the course of centuries the
custom of clerical ale-brewing and keeping a
“church-house” fell into disuse, and the house
itself generally became a village inn. In this
manner the singularly close neighbourhood of
village churches and inns, often curiously commented
upon, originated.</p>

<p>The church contains one rather pretty epitaph:</p>

<p>It is “To the memory of Mrs. Tamosin, wife
of Peter Lyde, Deceased ye 25 of Febru.
MDCLXIII,” and is inscribed upon a heart-shaped
mural monument:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Long may thy name, as long as marble, last,</div>
<div class="verse">Beloved Tamosin, though under clods here cast.</div>
<div class="verse">This formall heart doth truly signify</div>
<div class="verse">’Twixt wife and husband cordiell unity.</div>
<div class="verse">If to be graccius doth requir due praise</div>
<div class="verse">Let Tamosin have it, she deserves ye bayes.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is curious to observe how the “Mrs.” has
been inserted before “Tamosin,” as an afterthought.
We seem to see in it a post-mortem
jealousy on the part of the bereaved Peter Lyde
that any one should use the name of his lost
Tamosin without that formal title.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>The passengers landing at Duncannon Quay
are few; often there are none at all, and the few
are rarely other than country-folk making for
their quiet villages.</p>

<p>For the average tourist to land at Duncannon,
instead of completing the time-honoured trip
to Totnes, would be an originality never likely
to enter into the mind of him. He takes the
excursion trips as he finds them, and is content.
And, being content, who shall blame him? Not
I, for one; for his satisfaction with the well-worn
round is of itself no ignoble thing in this dear
Devonshire, where even the most frequented
circuits are exquisite, and crowds unknown.</p>

<p>So it happens that the explorer making for
Aish finds himself the only passenger for Duncannon,
and is like to feel important when for
him the steamer hoots and stops, and he goes
over the side into the ferry-boat, amid the interested
and wondering glances of the excursionists
for Totnes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Half-a-dozen strokes of the oars, and the boat
brings you to the quay, nestling by the quiet
waterside, where low cliffs of red earth dip to the
shore. “One penny, sir, please,” says the old
boatman, who, with straw-hat of primæval plait
and design, like a thatched roof, seems a survival
of the old Devonshire rustics, whose speech was
so unintelligible to those tourists who were the
first to ever burst into these unknown wilds.
Appearances, it is well known, are deceptive, and
here no less than elsewhere; for when you look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
upon the raw newness that has replaced the old
ramshackly and delightfully sketchable aspect
of Duncannon Quay, and remark upon the
change, this seeming survival says—oh, the shock
of it—“Oh, yes, it’s been thoroughly renovated.”
Not unjustifiably, I think, one feels aggrieved,
both at that renovation and at that departure
from the ancient Doric of the countryside. Time
was when this old lank boatman, with the clothes
that seem to have grown in one of his native
orchards, rather than to have been made, and
with a tanned and freckled face, the colour of the
russet apple;—time was, I say, when this ferryman,
who merely paddles about in this remote
nook of the Dart, would have phrased it differently,
and would have said: “’Ee’s proper did up,”
which is certainly more racy of Devon.</p>

<p>The “doing up” or the “renovation”—whichever
you will—of Duncannon Quay is certainly
thorough. Its two houses are faced with
that pallid stucco of which they are so alarmingly
fond in modern Devon; neat little white brick
piers stand in a neat little row, with neat little
railings in between, on the quayside; and a
corrugated tin hut is posted at the end. The
Philistines have descended upon Duncannon,
with a vengeance; and although the ferryman,
with his intimate knowledge of the moist Devon
climate, is of opinion that the newness will not
last long, we venture to think that when the
edge of novelty has been taken off by the weather,
it is shabbiness, and not picturesqueness, that will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
result. One thing is certain; neither moss nor
lichen ever yet grew on galvanized corrugated
iron.</p>

<p>Aish, we know, means Ash, and is merely the
old-world style of pronunciation crystallised in
writing, and perpetuated on many maps, but
our boatman styles it “Ash.” Yet even he is
not without some lingering relics of the old rustic
inflections, for he directs the enquirer to it by
advising him to “volley” the telephone wire.
A few years ago, one would have “volleyed”
the “telegraft”; yet another few years, with
wireless communication everywhere and all the
poles and wires abolished, and the chief landmark
and standby of local guides gone, what will the
stranger do then but lose his way?</p>

<p>There really are unusual numbers of ash
trees on the way to Aish, and fine ones, bordering
the road, or “Parliament Lane” as the rustics
yet know it, between Brixham, Yalberton, and
this historic hamlet. Two or three country seats
or villas, with a number of modern cottages, and
two or three ancient thatched dwellings: such is
Aish; but “Parliament House” is, after all,
not in Aish, but away, through it, considerably
on the other side, in a fine solitary situation at
the foot of a steep hill, in what is, with a peculiar
appropriateness, called Longcombe. It is not
difficult to see into the minds of those who selected
this cottage for that meeting. Aish is a small
hamlet now, and must have been very tiny then,
but that place was far too large and crowded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
where one house commanded another and where
the foregathering of fine gentlemen could be noted
and remembered against a possible day of reckoning.
So, through Aish and to Longcombe, those
cautious negotiators came and conducted their
parley in this leafy solitude. And although it
is on the direct road to Totnes, it is solitary still;
a place where on your approach you hear a child
say, in the softly reverberant Devon speech,
“Mothurr, here’s a man”; and mother, thus
advised, gazes long after the unwonted sight.</p>

<p class="caption">“PARLIAMENT HOUSE.”</p>
</div>

<p>I wish, for the sake of completeness, I could
say that an ash overhangs the road at this point:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
but I cannot. It is an oak, and a very fine oak,
which here frames in the picture made by the
old cottage at the foot of the hill.</p>

<p>Built of local ragstone and thatched, the old
dwelling has probably not been altered in any
particular since the memorable time of that secret
conclave, and it still belongs to the Seymours, or
St. Maurs, as they now—harking back to the
ancient spelling—choose to style themselves. The
historic association is the subject of a diffident
allusion inscribed in recent times on a stone pillar
in the garden:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

</div>

<p>The remainder of the voyage up the Dart to
Totnes is along a gradually narrowing stream,
past the noble hanging woods of Sharpham, to
Bridgetown Quay, where the road-bridge and the
narrowed river alike forbid further progress.</p>

<p>Of Totnes there is a great deal more to be
said than can be set down here. Between the
mythical legend of its being founded by Brutus
the Trojan and modern times, it has acquired a
history which demands volumes. It had a mint
in Saxon ages, is described as a walled town in
Domesday, and was not without some eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
rottenness as a rotten borough at the beginning
of the nineteenth century. It has a mystical
castle mound, with a circular shell of a keep on
the summit, an ancient gateway spanning the
main street, and an interesting old guildhall.
Its beautiful church is among the very finest in
Devon, and the quaint old piazza shops vie with
those of Dartmouth. There is, as may well be
supposed, much doubt of Brutus the Trojan having
been the founder of Totnes, but the legend is
indestructible, from very inability to disprove
it; besides, let into the pavement outside 51,
Fore Street, you are shown the very granite
boulder on which Brutus set foot when he landed!
and so he becomes associated, at the beginning
of the town’s long story, with a wanderer, in his
own way equally remarkable, at its close. For
in Totnes you may see, in the open space called
“The Plains,” a monument to William John Wills,
a native of the town, and son of a local doctor,
which narrates how he was born in 1834, emigrated
in 1852 to Australia, and, having been “the first
of mankind to cross the Australian Continent,
perished in returning.” He was a greater traveller
than Brutus; and his exploits, as we see, are
matters of ascertained fact.</p>

<span class="smaller">DARTMOUTH CASTLE—BLACKPOOL—SLAPTON SANDS—TORCROSS—BEESANDS—HALL
SANDS</span></h2>

<p>The little coach that runs daily from Dartmouth
to Kingsbridge has a steep climb up out of Dartmouth.
Here the pedestrian certainly has the
advantage, for, tracing his coastwise way round
through the woods of Warfleet creek, where a
disused limekiln by the waterside looks very like
an ancient defensible tower, he comes at last
upon the strangely grouped church of St. Petrox,
the Castle, and the abandoned modern battery,
all standing in a position of romantic beauty,
where the sea dashes in violence upon the dark
rocks. The “garrison” of Dartmouth Castle in
these days is generally a sergeant of garrison
artillery retired from active service, or in some
condition of military suspended animation not
readily to be understood by a logically minded
civilian. It is a situation worthy of comic opera:
in which you perceive the War Office erecting
batteries for defending the entrance to the harbour,
and then, having completed them, furnishing
the works with obsolete muzzle-loaders, capable
of impressing no one save the most ignorant of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
persons. Then, these popguns having been demonstrated
useless, even to the least instructed,
they are removed at great expense, and their
places left empty: it having occurred in the
meanwhile to the wiseacres ruling the Army that,
in any case, under modern conditions, a hostile
fleet would be able to keep well off shore and to
throw shells into Dartmouth, without coming in
range of any ordnance ever likely to be placed at
the castle.</p>

<p>So the sergeant-in-charge, who lives here with
his wife and family, and is apparently given free
quarters and no pay, on the implied condition
that he makes what he can out of tips given by
tourists, is not burdened with military responsibilities.
The present incumbent appears to have
developed strong antiquarian tastes, is learned in
the local military operations of Cromwell’s era,
and a successful seeker after old-time cannonballs
and other relics of strange, unsettled times.</p>

<p>You cannot choose but explore the interior
of the Castle, for as you approach there is, although
you may not suspect it, an Eye noting the fact.
The Eye is the sergeant’s, and there is that way
about old soldiers which admits of no denial when
he proposes that he shall show you over. You
are shepherded from one little room to another,
peer from what the sergeant calls the “embershaws”
(by which he means embrasures), and
then, offering the expected tribute for seeing very
little, depart.</p>

<p>The coastguard path ascends steeply from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Dartmouth Castle and follows a rough course
along a deeply indented headland of dark slate-rock,
that plunges almost everywhere, without
hesitation, into deep water. Patches of sands
are few and inaccessible; and, confronting every
good ship making from the south-west for Dartmouth,
the black Ham Stone rises with an ugly
menace from sunshiny seas, ringed around with
its own little circle of foam. Thus you come,
round Hollowcombe Head and Redlap Cove to
Stoke Fleming, past rocky bastions, where the
rival yellows of sea-poppy and yellow toad-flax
enliven the dark slate, and the Devon “wall-flower”
the spur valerian, not the gilly-flower—flourishes
bravely in occasional masonry walls.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Stoke Fleming, standing high and wind-swept,
is of a Cornish sternness, and its great dark church
tower is so bleak-looking, that not even the sunniest
day can put a cheerful complexion upon it. It
was built in the Perpendicular period, and is just
about as complete an example of long-drawn
perpendicularity as can be imagined, rising, stage
upon stage, until at last it ends, for all the world
as though the old-time architect of it had gone
on, like a child building with a “box of bricks,”
as far as he dared. A perky little banneret vane
on the roof aids this impression. Ferns grow
plentifully in the joints of the masonry, to the
very summit, and are every now and then removed,
but they always reappear. The tower is said to
have been built as a mark for sailors, but however
that may be, it is certainly one of a very numerous
type in South Devon, and own brother to that of
Halwell, quite six miles from the sea.</p>

<p>Below Stoke Fleming lies the charmingly
sequestered glen of Blackpool, where a little
stream comes out of an emerald valley and oozes
away through a perfect semicircle of sands, guarded
by pinnacled rocks. Dense masses of trees, some of
them strangely exotic in appearance, overhang the
road. This quiet and beautiful spot was the scene
of a descent by the Bretons in 1403. An expedition
set out from across the Channel, under the command
of one Du Chatel, and after raiding Tenby
and Plymouth came ashore at Blackpool with the
object of taking Dartmouth in the rear. Unfortunately
for them, the Devonshire folk had got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
wind of what was in store, and when the raiders
landed they happened unexpectedly upon some
six hundred defenders, lying hid until the supreme
moment, behind entrenchments. Among these
valiant defenders of hearth and home were many
women, who fought like devils and slew great
numbers of Breton knights and men-at-arms with
catapults. Only a sorry remnant of the invaders
escaped those gentle creatures, and Dartmouth
was on that occasion saved. But, bolder and
with the reward of boldness, others came the next
year and sailed in to Dartmouth town and burnt
it to the ground.</p>

<p class="caption">BLACKPOOL SANDS.</p>
</div>

<p>Blackpool sands were destined to witness a
yet more historic landing, for it was here that the
great Earl of Warwick, the “Kingmaker,” who had
made Edward the Fourth king, and then quarrelled
with his handiwork, came back from exile in 1471,
with an armed expedition, intent upon unmaking
him. It was Warwick’s last throw, and ended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
a few weeks later with his defeat and death at the
battle of Barnet.</p>

<p>Sunday-school treats are held nowadays on
the golden sands of Blackpool; sands that in
more than a figurative sense have been found
golden, for a discovery was made here in modern
times of gold coins dating from that period, and
doubtless lost in the confusion of the landing.</p>

<p>The entirely uninteresting hamlet of Street
passed, standing at the head of the next rise, the
road goes, steep and winding, down to one of the
most remarkable stretches of coast-line in Devon;
the famous Slapton Sands, a flat two miles of
raised beach along which, ages ago, the present
high road was formed. The sands take their
name from the village of Slapton, a mile inland,
and consist of small shingle thrown up by the
sea, and banking back the outflow of three streams,
which thus forms a long and marshy freshwater
lake, the whole length of this shingly bank. Just
as you come down-hill upon the finest view from
above of the sea, the sands, the Ley, as this
freshwater lake is named, a long and lofty blank
wall shuts out the scene and proclaims the malignant
humour of the landowner who built it.</p>

<p>Sparse and hungry-looking grass grows on
the ridge of the shingle, but the yellow sea-poppy
thrives, and so does the spurge, or milkwort,
whose poisonous juice is milk-white and innocent-looking.
Here, too, on the inner face of the bank,
looking upon the rush-grown waters of the Ley,
the purple blossoms and hairy leaves of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
mallow are abundant, while bordering the highway,
and braving the dust of it, are masses of the
thrift or sea-pink.</p>

<p>The Ley, or Lea, is one of the most noted
resorts of wild birds in Devon, and its two hundred
acres are frequented in winter by sportsmen,
whose headquarters are the lonely “Sands Hotel,”
standing solitary, a mile from anywhere, on the
shingly ridge, facing the sea one way, and on the
other the highroad and the Ley.</p>

<p>The waters of the Ley are crowded with
ferocious pike and other fish, and the vast banks
of sedge and rush are peopled thickly, not only
with the winter concourse of wild duck and geese,
but with the shy birds of the fields and woods.
Inland, the marshy lowlands ascend gently, with
white-faced cottages in little groups among the
trees, and an old bridge spans the water at a
favourable point and helps a bye-road on the way
to Slapton. The scene is not greatly disturbed;
the midday coach comes by on the high road, with
a cheerful tootling of its horn, and disappears,
on the way to Torcross; a wild bird pipes as it
flies overhead, and a fish leaps up from the still
water, after a fly; that is the summer aspect.
But in winter the wild-fowler wakes the echoes of
the hills with his sport, and when the gales blow
strong out of the south-west there is a sea-wrack
in the air and foam in the road, that make the
enterprise of walking from Street to Torcross
almost as wet a business as sea-bathing.</p>

<p>Torcoss is a hamlet at the extremity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Sands, where the road turns inland to Charleton,
Stokenham, and Kingsbridge. Its back is to the
slightly projecting headland that divides these
sands from the further stretches of sand and
shingle, extending towards the Start, and with
an air of wondering mildly at its own existence,
and further wondering if it is really worth while
to exist at all, it faces the long flat road along
which we have come. Of all the unlikely places,
here is an hotel, and out of that hotel, as the
present chronicler passed, there came a German
waiter in a dress suit, and stood on the beach
among the bronzed fishermen, watching the evolutions
of a naval squadron, half a mile off-shore,
in the deep water of Start Bay. Thinking many
things and strange, I passed upon my way.</p>

<p>The direct road to Kingsbridge lies to the right
hand, through Stokenham. That the quiet of
country life was in the long ago occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
broken by picturesque doings denied to us is
evident in this extract from the parish records
of the year 1581:</p>

<p>Another interesting record at Stokenham—which,
by the way, you must be careful not to
pronounce “Stok’n’am” but “Stoke-en-ham,”
as though it were a dish, like eggs-and-ham—is
the epitaph upon:</p>

<p>This is a relic of the siege of Salcombe Castle
and the military operations between Cavaliers
and the Parliament troops. It seems that the
Puritan soldiery, attacking a farm-house, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
met with a stout resistance and fired through a
window, mortally wounding the farmer’s daughter.</p>

<p>To follow the coast from Torcross to the Start,
it is necessary at this point to take to the sands,
or, more strictly speaking, the shingle; extremely
heavy walking, but endurable on account of the
interesting rocks piled up in huge masses on the
shore. The slaty cliffs have here fallen in ruins,
with picturesque results. Some of the great blocks
twenty feet or more in height, have sides quite
smooth and lustrous.</p>

<p>We are here in a district not indeed far removed
from modern accommodation, but in the
same primitive condition as it must have been a
century, or even more, ago. The fine shingle gives
place to a waste of laminated slate and then,
where the cliffs die away for a space into a marshy
bottom, to a scrubby flat piece of waste leading
to the hamlet of Beesands, marked on many maps
as Beeson Cellar.</p>

<p>Beesands has a perpetual air of rejoicing, for
on every fine day the waste between the sea and
the one row of fishermen’s cottages flies its banners
to sea and sky. It is only the domestic wash
hung out to dry, but the effect is one of festival.</p>

<p>There is a something Irish in the look and the
manners and customs of Beesands. The drying-ground
of washing and of fishing-nets is rich in
old tins and brickbats, and is populated numerously
with fowls, housed as a rule in decayed
boats turned keel upward. They are the most
trustful cocks and hens in the world, and follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the fishermen into the inn and the cottages like

<p>A tourist not preoccupied with the arts would
inevitably style this a “miserable place,” a
“wretched hole,” or other things uncomplimentary;
but to a painter, wanting atmosphere
and utter unconventionality, it is delightful.
Poor fisherfolk are its only inhabitants, and its
one inn neither offers accommodation to the
tourist, nor, if it did, would he be likely to accept
it. For one thing, strangers, either here or at
the sister hamlet of Hall Sands are rare, both
places being innocent of roads of any kind. Just
a row of rude whitewashed cottages on the level:
that is Beesands, and just a double row of somewhat
superior cottages on the cliffside; that is
Hall Sands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>A mile of climbing up cliff paths and scrambling
down, and then across another scrubby bottom
where the white campions grow, brings the
adventurous stranger to Hall Sands, built into
the tall dark cliffs, just as the house-martens
plaster their nests against the eaves. The hardihood—the
foolhardihood, if you like it better—that
ever induced mortal man to build houses in
this perilous position under the threatening eaves
of the cliffs and on the margin of the waves can
only be appreciated by those who look upon the
place itself. It beggars description.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>The scene is one of a wild beauty, the cliffs
rising dark and craggy overhead, draped thickly
with ivy, the end of the street blocked with
gigantic masses of fallen rock, and the sea at
the very foot of some of the houses; with here
and there a narrow strip of beach.</p>

<p>The hardy fisherfolk exist chiefly on seine-net
fishing and crab and lobster-catching. The trained
Newfoundland dogs that are still a feature of
this hamlet and of Beesands are fewer than of
yore. There were some seven or eight of them,
taught to swim out through the particularly
rough surf of this shore, to meet incoming boats
and bring the end of a rope to the beach, so that
the boats might be hauled in.</p>

<p>The later history of Hall Sands is somewhat
thrilling. It seems that for some years past
the shingle in front of Hall Sands has been dredged
away by the contractors for the extension works
at Keyham Dockyard, Plymouth, for the purpose
of making concrete, and that the Government
committed the incredible folly of allowing it.
The inevitable and foretold result happened. In
September 1903 most of the foreshore disappeared
in a storm, and in the spring of 1904 the very
existence of Hall Sands was threatened. The
one inn of the place, the “London,” stood with
other cottages on a piece of rock jutting out to
sea. Suddenly, one afternoon, a heavy ground-swell
wrecked them. The landlady was making
tea, when the side of the house disappeared,
without warning. Since then Hall Sands has
been without an inn. To help build the new
concrete sea-wall and the slipway, which have
since been built in the effort to remove the danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
that ought never to have been incurred, the Government
granted £1,750, while the Member of
Parliament for the county division subscribed
£250, and the contractors contributed an unascertained
sum. The whole miserable history
would assure us, if we did not already know it,
that Governments—it matters not of what party—are
entirely callous upon subjects that do not
endanger their own existence. Now if this had
happened in Ireland, the outcry against the
“murdering Saxon” would have been appalling.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE START AND ITS TRAGEDIES—LANNACOMBE—CHIVELSTONE—EAST
PRAWLE—PORTLEMOUTH</span></h2>

<p>The Start looms up prominently from here, but
it is a long scramble up out of Hall Sands and
round by the coastguard path to that weird spot.</p>

<p>The uncanny-looking Start has impressed itself
upon the imaginations of most of those who have
seen it. Polwhele, the historian of Devon, led
to the thought by the fantastic solemnity of the
rocky headland, and by the sound of its name,
gravely assures us that here, in the dim dawn of
history, stood a temple of the Phœnician goddess,
Astarte, the “Ashtoreth” of the full-blooded
Scriptural denunciations of the “worshippers of
strange gods”; the more suave and worshipful
Venus Aphrodite of the Greeks, fair goddess of
the sea.</p>

<p>The Start—Start “Point” is a redundancy—has,
however, nothing to do with heathen
mythology, suitable though it be, above all places,
for altars of hungry sea-gods. The name of the
headland is the Anglo-Saxon “Steort,” which
itself means simply a point or tail; as seen in the
name of the Redstart, or “redtail”; but to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
fanciful, these cruel rocks, the scene of so many
fearful wrecks, seem not unlike the sacrificial
altars of some blood-stained superstitious cult.</p>

<p>The Start projects far out to sea, a dark mass
of gneiss rock with quartz veins. It is in the
uncomfortable shape of a razor-backed ridge, with
demoniacal-looking humps, spires, and spines of
iron-hard rock, ranging from prominences like the
vertebræ of a crocodile’s back to sharp points
in the likeness of hedge-stakes. The weird imagination
of Doré never conceived anything in
scenery more shuddery than that of the Start,
and the coastguards, who declare that you have
not seen England until you have come to the
extremity of this difficult point, are not without
some reason for their cryptic saying.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus53">

<p class="caption">THE START.</p>
</div>

<p>It behoves the stranger to be careful how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
he comes to his exploration, for this, Λ, is the
section of the Start. Sloping sides of short
slippery grass at an alarming angle descend
dangerously to the sea from the serrated skyline,
and a false step will send you rolling down to
those rocks that have proved fatal to full many
a shipwrecked mariner.</p>

<p>It is some sixty years since the lighthouse
at the extremity of the point was built. The
lantern of it is two hundred feet above the sea;
and shows two lights, lit every evening, ten
minutes before sunset: a revolving beam once
every minute for vessels out in the Channel, and
a constant fixed gleam for shore-going boats, to
warn them off the Skerries bank.</p>

<p>But, for all these safeguards, the Start remains
a fatal point. When a “snorter” from the
south-west, or a fog, sends vessels out of their
course upon this coast, they are doomed. The
lights are next to useless in foggy weather and
at such time the fog-horn, bellowing in unearthly
manner, is fraught with every kind of tragical
suggestion.</p>

<p>Among the many wrecks of modern times is
that of the <i>Spirit of the Ocean</i>, March 23rd, 1866,
when twenty-eight out of thirty were drowned,
the <i>Gossamer</i>, China tea-clipper, driven ashore
between the Start and Prawle Point in December
1868, when thirteen of a crew of thirty-one were
lost; the <i>Emilie</i>, laden with saltpetre, broken
up during a fog in June 1870; and the <i>Lalla
Rookh</i>, a large vessel, coming home from Shanghai,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
laden with 1,300 tons of tea and 60 tons of tobacco,
wrecked in March 1873 near Prawle Point.
Shortly before the vessel struck she ran so close
to the rocks that four of her crew jumped on to
them as she flew by; but this was a wreck which
did not touch the deepest note of tragedy, for
in the end, all but one of those on board were
saved. There was, however, a woeful waste of
cargo, and the little beaches near by, and the
long three miles of Slapton Sands, were for days
strewn in places with the wreckage of the <i>Lalla
Rookh</i>, and ridges of tea eleven feet high, and
trails of tobacco of almost equal size, were piled
up at high-water mark by the waves.</p>

<p>Most dramatic was the wreck of the steamship
<i>Marana</i>, in the wild blizzard of March 9th, 1891.
As night closed down upon the wild scene off
the Start, the lighthouse-keeper’s wife, looking
forth from behind a window, upon that seething
world of torn sea and whirling snowflakes, thought
she saw a vessel drive through the smother of
it, under the lighthouse. No help was possible,
and the vessel was gone like a ghost. The tale
that was afterwards told was a pitiful one.</p>

<p>Just before the vessel struck, and was broken
in two, amidship, the crew made for shore, twenty-two
of them in the lifeboat and four others in a
smaller. The surf in Lannacombe Bay was so
great that they dared not attempt a landing,
and made for Prawle, where the lifeboat was
smashed to pieces on the Mag Ledge. Most of
the unfortunate sailors were drowned, only four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
surviving to tell the tale. A fifth, who had
managed to drag himself, bruised and bleeding,
from the rocks to land, lay down, exhausted,
for shelter, and died out there in the snow. It
was not until a fortnight later that his body
was found.</p>

<p>It was on the same occasion that the <i>Dryad</i>
was totally wrecked at the extremity of the
Start at midnight, and all hands lost. One
survivor was seen at daybreak, clinging to a
rock, but before help could reach him he was
washed away.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of the Start is an unsatisfactory
place to be in on a day threatening rain,
for it is outside roads, and the more than knee-high
bracken of the coastguard paths is at such
times a supersaturating growth. And the way
up-along and down-along and round this way
and that, past Pear Tree Point, where there are
not any pear-trees (and I dare swear there never
were any) is toilsome. Beyond the Point is the
yellow strand of Lannacombe, famous for Lannacombe
Mill and its miller, who, when French
privateers were here, there, and everywhere in the
old rumbustious days and visited him one night,
flung his money-bag out of window and found it,
safe enough, the next morning, suspended in an
elder-bush. The guide-books tell how the ruins
of the mill may be seen, but they shyly hide
themselves from some, and the other Lannacombe
Mill, up the combe, which may not be historic in
this small sort, is at any rate picturesque enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
to be excused a story. If one were not afraid of
getting wet through on a moist afternoon, here
by the clucking water-wheel and the moss-grown
walls and the clear-running mill-leat should some
hours be whiled away.</p>

<p class="caption">CHIVELSTONE: A RAINY DAY.</p>
</div>

<p>But the day that had gloomed at length grew
damp, and necessity compelled a double-quick
to the most accessible village: that of Chivelstone.
On the way to it, that fine rain characteristic of
Devonshire came down like smoke from the hills.
“’Tes what us carls a miz-wet,” said a farm-labourer,
trudging home contentedly beneath a
thick covering of potato-sacks; and they do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
call it amiss, for the mist is undeniable, and there
is no mistaking the wetness of it.</p>

<p>A traveller’s curse upon all landowners who
suppress inns, and all villages without spirit
sufficient to maintain one. Here the “Seven
Stars” inn of guide-books, the only inn of Chivelstone,
was not in existence, and this obviously
was no resting-place. So to East Prawle, along
a featureless road, in a wet and swirling fog, the
way made musical with the howls and trumpetings
of the Start fog-horn.</p>

<p>East Prawle ceased its growth in the act of
developing from a farm-yard into a village; so
that there are cottages where there should be
ricks and cow-byres, and muck where there
should be houses. Grass grows and liquid manure
lies in the road, and stones and rocks in the
pastures; and, altogether, Prawle, which is a
very undesirable spot of earth, is a splendid
example of matter in the wrong place.</p>

<p>But gentility of a kind has come to Prawle.
You can never tell: the wind bloweth where it
listeth; overmantels and preposterous photograph-frames,
to say nothing of spiky articles of furniture
in bamboo-ware, all projections and easily overset
through the window, are to be found in the
unlikeliest places. And that is how—Heaven
help them and us!—they spell gentility at
Prawle.</p>

<p>The Point—well-known by name to diligent
readers of the shipping news in the daily papers—is
crowned at Hurter’s Top with the Lloyd’s signal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
station, where the vessels going out and home
are “spoken.” It is a rude and jagged Point,
and its rugged character lends it an air of greater
height than it possesses. It rises suddenly out
of a down, sloping towards the sea, and may be
compared with the appearance of a hacked and
uneven quarter of a round Dutch cheese. Off
this point H.M.S. <i>Crocodile</i> was wrecked, and on
the next westerly headland, Gammon Head, two
Spanish galleons.</p>

<p>All the way round from this point the great
dark mass of Bolt Head shows finely, away across
the arm of the sea running up between Portlemouth
and Salcombe. Portlemouth, although of so
impressive a name, is a meagre place on the very
crest of the rugged upland overlooking Salcombe
and the Kingsbridge River, and consists of merely
a farmhouse with a few cottages grouped round
the ancient church of St. Onolaus, otherwise,
abating that Latinised form, the early sixth-century
British St. Winwaloe. The horribly plastered
exterior of the tower would dissuade many
from seeking a further acquaintance with the
church, by which the finely carved and painted
thirteenth-century rood screen would be missed.
In the churchyard, to the north-west of the tower,
is a grim slate headstone, with a still more grim
epitaph, on one “Richard Jarvis, of Rickham
in this parish, who departed this life the 25th day
of May 1782, aged 79:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Through poison he was cut off</div>
<div class="verse">And brought to death at last.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
<div class="verse">It was by his apprentice-girl,</div>
<div class="verse">On whom there’s sentence past.</div>
<div class="verse">O may all people warning take,</div>
<div class="verse">For she was burnèd at the stake.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The interesting person, who thus cheated the
unfortunate Richard Jarvis of the few years that
probably, in the course of nature, would have
remained to him, was one Rebecca Downing, who
was executed at the end of the following July
at Ringswell, Heavitree, near Exeter; the old-time
spot where Devonshire criminals and martyrs
suffered; but this was really not quite so fearful
an execution as it looks, for she was first hanged
and her body then cut down and burnt. The exceptional
treatment of hanging and then burning
the body of the criminal was owing to the crime
being, over and above that of murder, the particularly
heinous one, in the eye of the old laws,
of <i>petit treason</i>, the murdered person being the
master of, and person in authority over, the assassin.</p>

<p>Coming down a breakneck path from Portlemouth
to the ferry, you find yourself come, not
only to an out-of-the-way spot, but to a place
where, for the first time, you have a foretaste of
the Cornish way of speech. Some one aboard the
ferry-boat compares this arm of the sea with
Fowey. “Aw, my dear man,” says the ferryman,
“’tes wider yur than ’tes tu Foy: ees, feth.”</p>

<p>That is a kind of middle-marches compromise
between the Devon talk and that of Cornwall,
where, instead of say “yes, faith,” they say, “iss,
fay.”</p>

<p>It is quite a narrow passage across the Kingsbridge
River to Salcombe, and shut in majestically by
dark rocks and a winding channel. The little
town dabbles its feet in the deep water of this
arm of the sea, and is in every way a fishy and
marine place; but, unless you are lodged in one
or other of the houses that rise sheer from the
water, it is little or nothing of the sea you will get
a sight of. Only from the two narrow alleys leading
to the ferry stairs, or down the infrequent passages
on to littery quays, is any outlook possible; and
it is quite a mile before the jealously walled-in
villas and estates of the outskirts cease and one
comes to the little bay of South Sands. The
naturally uncomfortable physical circumstances
of Salcombe, which has no foreshore for the visitor,
no pier, and no seats anywhere, are jealously
preserved in all their rigours by the luxurious
villadom of the place, which has hitherto succeeded
in keeping the railway out, and would, if it were
possible, put a ring-fence around the neighbourhood
and exclude every one but those who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
necessary to minister to their wants. Salcombe
is probably the most exclusive place on this, or
any other coast, and its exclusiveness is, singularly
enough, shared by all classes in the place. Here
is a literally reproduced conversation that enforces
the point.</p>

<p>And that’s true enough, as Kingsbridge has
discovered. Meanwhile, Salcombe remains a place
which may not inaptly be compared with a lobster
pot or a beetle-trap. It is not difficult to enter,
but it <i>is</i> difficult to leave, unless you are prepared

<p>Touch is kept with the outer world by means
of an omnibus to Kingsbridge and by a steamer
plying up and down the river; and sometimes the

comes at last to a safe haven in Plymouth Barbican
after having casually taken ground on a mud-bank

Packet is not precisely a liner, and is indeed a
cargo-boat which does not even disdain potatoes
and live sheep.</p>

<p>“Kingsbridge River” is altogether a misnomer.
It is a five-mile long inlet of the sea, with numerous
subsidiary creeks winding between the hills. The
scenery is rendered comparatively desolate by
the lack of woods, and it is of a peculiar solitude.
Kingsbridge town itself sits at the head of the
creek, and is a thriving little place. The villages
of Charleton, Frogmore, and South Pool stand on
their respective creeks.</p>

<p>Salcombe is not a little proud of its literary
association with Froude, who entertained Tennyson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
at his residence, Woodcot, toward the close of
their respective careers, and it is a cherished article
of faith that the Poet Laureate here received the

<p class="caption">SALCOMBE CASTLE.</p>
</div>

<p>Salcombe Castle, or Fort Charles, situated on
a rocky islet off South Sands, was a ruinous
mediæval tower in the time of the Cromwellian
wars, but the perfervid loyalty of the West repaired
it and fortified the place with cannon, throwing in
an armed garrison, fully provisioned, at a cost,
as the surviving accounts state, of £3,196 14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
During a four months’ bombardment in 1646,
in which the gunners were such extravagantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
bad marksmen that only one person on each side
was killed, Sir Edmund Fortescue held the fort,
and then, only through some doubts of the loyalty
of members of his garrison, capitulated and
marched out, with guns firing, drums beating,
and colours flying, to the seclusion of his own
mansion at Fallapit. The bravado of this capitulation
was more fatal than the siege, for three
persons were accidentally shot.</p>

<p>If the landowners of Salcombe had their way
it is little of the coast scenery hereabouts the
public would see. Of late years the grassy summit
of the cliffs looking upon Salcombe Castle has
been enclosed and planted, and now, passing the
inlet of South Sands, and coming to Splatt’s Cove,
a notice-board beside the path announces that
“by the order of Ford’s Trustees” there is no
right of way. My own advice to those who are
confronted with notices such as this is, enter if
you wish; and in this instance the Salcombe
Urban District Council have given the lie direct
to the impudent contention of the Trustees, and
have erected a prominent notice of their own,
side by side with the other, stating that, notwithstanding
this warning, a right of way <i>does</i> exist.</p>

<p>Changeful has been the policy here. A former
Earl of Devon, resident at the Moult, caused the
Courtenay Walk to be cut midway up the once-inaccessible
face of the cliffs round to Bolt Head,
or, to speak by the card, “The Bolt.” And now,
passing the mutually destructive notices above
Splatt’s Cove, and under a recently built hotel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
we find the entrance to that walk flanked with
offensively worded injunctions to keep to the
path; by which it is abundantly evident that the
present owner would dearly like to close it altogether.
Here stands, or clings, a modern villa,
on the edge of the sloping cliff, with a little terrace
down below, like a tiny gun-platform.</p>

<p>The Walk begins by burrowing through a
stunted wood, that looks romantic enough to be
pixie-haunted. And, by the same token, the
foxglove grows abundantly in its shade, so the
pixies must needs foregather here; for the foxglove
provides gloves for the little “folk” and has
nothing at all to do with foxes. They are the
splendidest gloves you ever saw, much superior
to the best <i>gants de suéde</i> that ever were, and
neither Fownes nor Dent and Allcroft have ever
made anything like them. That is quite certain.
And if you come here at midnight and turn round
three times and say “willie-willie wiskins,” you
will see—what you <i>will</i> see. I can say no more
than that, because whoso gives away the secrets
of the little folk is lost.</p>

<p class="caption">THE PINNACLES, BOLT HEAD.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond the wood you come to very weird
scenery indeed, along the boulderesque footpath,
with bracken and hoar rock intermingled, and
the blue sea below on the left and great grey spires
of cliff overhead on the right, splashed with lichens
red, golden, tawny, pallid green—all colours.
Then rise in front of you the Pinnacles. You see
at once, when you are come in sight of them, that
you are come by quick change from the territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of the little folk into some Arthuresque land of
the giants, for the great fantastic pinnacles are in
twisted and contorted forms that suggest having
originally been fashioned when warm and plastic
by some Titan hand.</p>

<p>The slaty stratification of the surrounding
rocks lends itself to the most outlandish horrent
shapes of monstrous jibing faces, anvils, halberds,
battle axes, and the likeness of a perfect armoury
of magic weapons of offence, taking their most
uncanny guise in the ragged mists that almost
always enwrap and cling about The Bolt.</p>

<p>It seems that, contrary to general belief, this
headland, of which these Pinnacles are the culminating
point, is not the real Bolt Head. It is
the further point, across the intervening valley,
where the explorer finds the coastguard path
die away, and himself perilously walking on the
treacherous grassy slopes, where a slip will conduct
at express speed on to some particularly sharp
and cruel-looking rocks. It is like an inferno
down there, in the sense that the descent is fatally
easy, and to retrace one’s steps—or rather, flight—impossible.
It is here that, warily shirking the
point, you wish you hadn’t come; that you were
a goat or a chamois, or, at the very least of it, that
you had spikes in the soles of your shoes.</p>

<p>But they are lovely, as well as awe-inspiring,
glimpses down there, sheer into the sea, where the
cliff-walls are as black as coal and the sea now a
dark, now a light green, here and there ringing
a half-submerged rock with creamy foam. Hollow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
sound the surges in those cavernous depths, and
reverberant the cries of the seagulls. Such is the
extremity of the real Bolt, out yonder.</p>

<p>The descent from the Pinnacles leads down
into a solitary valley, with towering fantastic
rocks on the one side and the sea on the other. A
deserted cottage standing near the sea emphasises
the loneliness. The cottage has a story, for it
was built to house the submarine cable from Brest,
landed here in May 1870. Here, thank goodness,
you plunge out of the over-civilisation of to-day,
and, leaving hotels behind, come for a space into
something of the rural England of sixty years
since. Here, where nature is so beautiful and
the littlenesses of towns are left behind, one can
understand something of that latter-day portent,
Anarchism, which, in this close touch with mother
earth, reveals itself as a divine discontent with
lovely things exploited and degraded, rather than
the bogey of statesmen and sociologists.</p>

<p>Stair Hole Bottom they call this valley. It is
carpeted with bracken; a little peaty stream
comes oozing along in boggy places, or purling,
as from the lip of a jug, over scattered boulders,
overhung by the nodding foxglove. It is, in a
word, Cornish, rather than Devonian, and, as
commonly is the case in Cornwall, you have to
pick your way among the chancy places, for lack
of road or path.</p>

<p>Looking back, the Pinnacles show fitfully
through the mist, the hole through them, like an
All-seeing Eye, glowering darkly as the mists close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
in, or lightening, with a tinge of beneficence, in
the sun.</p>

<p>On those moist, hot, steamy Devonshire days,
when the mist, condensed off the sea, rolls like
smoke over the rocky ledges, you look over the
cliffs’ edge into a pillowy whiteness, which, for
all you may discover, is the next field, or a sheer
drop of three hundred feet on to a rocky beach.
But through the smother, like a warning cry, comes
dully the turmoil of the waves, the husky voice
of the sea, sounding to the unromantic Londoner
like the roaring of the traffic in his native streets,
as heard from one of the metropolitan parks.</p>

<p>The coastguard path is rugged and perilous,
and the whitened stones of it are apt to fail one
at critical moments, like moral resolutions in the
pathway of life. Sometimes they are not there
at all, and in some spots they are so overgrown
with bracken that you barge into them unawares,
with painful results.</p>

<p>Up at Clewer signal station, where the coastguard,
outside his tiny whitewashed hut, does
incomprehensible things with strings of flags,
the wild growths of these downs run riot, kept
in subjection only by the winds, which have
imposed the oddest shapes upon them. The
gorse-bushes have been buffeted by them into
closely compacted hummocky figures, the heather
is disposed in hemispherical groups, the brambles,
turn in upon themselves in a way the free-born
hedgerow bramble would despise, and only the
bracken, which is a summer growth and, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
grass of the field, here to-day and gone to-morrow,
is independent and upstanding. The beautiful
bracken! Come here in July, and you will think
all the strawberries in the world are on t’other
side of the next shoulder of hill; for in that month
the bracken has a perfume like that of the ripest
and choicest and sweetest strawberries ever grown.</p>

<p>There are rabbits on these uplands, as with a
painful wrench of the ankle you are not unlikely
to discover, when your foot plunges unexpectedly
into one of their burrows. There are moles, too,
evidently, and slow-worms wriggle plentifully
across the path.</p>

<p>And thus, now up, now down and around, with
the perspiration streaming from you in the still,
close hollows, and drying off on the breezy heights,
you come by astonishing rocks down to a little
sandy rock-girt cove, solitary, without even a
Man Friday’s footprints on the yellow sand,
through which a little stream trickles. But
though no human footprint may be seen, the
sands are patterned by the thousand with the
broad-arrow prints of the gulls’ feet, as though the
War Office had descended upon the place and
thus prodigally marked it for its ownest own.</p>

<p>One could and two could even better—go
a-Robinson-Crusoeing here very comfortably for
awhile in the summer, with the aid of a tent,
despite the unlovely name of the place, which is
Sewer Mill Cove.</p>

<p>What’s in a name? Not much here, at any
rate, for it has really nothing to do with drains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
There are several “sewer” farms in the neighbourhood,
east and west, and the district in general is
called “The Sewers”: the name deriving from
the Anglo-Saxon description of the folk living
here, the “Sæware,” the sea-folk, as distinguished
from those who, living a little more inland, obtained
their livelihood from the land. The process
by which the place took its name is not an unusual
one; and Canterbury—the “burgh of the Kent-ware,”
or Kentish folk—may be taken as a
prominent and familiar instance.</p>

<p>Sewer Mill Cove was the scene in 1885 of one
of the many wrecks that have made this coast
dreaded by mariners, for then the <i>Hallowe’en</i>
teaship was cast away here, fortunately without
loss of life.</p>

<p>The downs here, at the summit of the cliffs
between this and Hope, are those of Bolberry,
whence comes, some consider, the name of Bolt
Head. Heather clothes them and the cliff-tops
with a more than imperial magnificence. Imperial
mantles are poor things and tawdry beside such
purple splendour. If Solomon in all his glory
were not arrayed like the lilies of the field, certainly
no emperor has ever attained to the
gorgeousness of the heather.</p>

<p>It is an untameable wilderness on these heights,
for the land is of such negative quality that it
is worth no farmer’s while to touch it, and moreover,
great fissures and holes, like those of earthquakes,
partly masked by undergrowth, exist
here. The country people speak of them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Ralph’s Pits, Vincent Pits, Rotten Pits. Ralph,
they tell you, was a smuggler, and that is the
closest touch you can make to him. Ralph is as
insubstantial as the mists that come streaking
over the downs.</p>

<p>Now we come to Bolt Tail and the signal-station,
overlooking Ramilies Cove, where the
<i>Ramilies</i> man-o’-war was wrecked in 1760. Seven
hundred and eight of the seven hundred and thirty
four men on board perished. Down below lies Hope
village, in its tiny cove, where an island can be seen
in the making; a great mass of rock dividing the
cove in two being joined to the mainland only by
strips of sand and heaps of tumbled boulders. It
was here that one of the many ships of the Spanish
Armada was wrecked: so many ships and so
many wrecks that the pen revolts from writing
about them, even as the London apprentices
revolted, in the centuries gone by, against salmon
every day. These Spanish Armada ships are the
“salmon every day,” or the <i>toujours perdrix</i>, if
you like to put it in terms of a surfeit of game, of
the historian of the coasts. Scarce a cove but
they dashed their stout timbers to pieces upon
its rocks, and those beaches are few that have no
legends of silver ingots, pieces of eight, moidores,
doubloons, dollars, and all the glittering galaxy
of treasure-trove deriving from such a romantic
source; but devil a dollar has rewarded the quest
of this pilgrim, errant with the best will to it.</p>

<p>Then, if you have faith, you may see in every
dark-featured Devonian a descendant from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
captured or shipwrecked Don. There are the
names of Miggs and Jenny (among others), which
may, or again may not, derive from Miguel and
Jeronimo, and Cantrell has been recognised as
a debased form of Alcantara, but ’tis a far cry.
Here, at any rate, we know the name and rating
of the Spanish vessel. She was the hospital-ship
<i>St. Peter the Great</i>, and was on her way home,
after having, in flight from Drake and his fellows,
circumnavigated Great Britain. One hundred and
fifty of the one hundred and ninety aboard of her
were saved; and possibly the Delmers, the Jaggers,
and the Murrens to be met with are descendants
of that crew.</p>

<p>Hope is just bidding “good day t’ye” to the
old immemorial times, when it was just a hamlet
of crabbers and lobster-catchers and the like,
for villas and bungalows are putting the old
cottages of cob and rock to shame, and they are
becoming, although still a small community, as
up-to-date as you please, or you don’t please.
No longer, I think, is the once-famous “White
Ale” of South Devon made or sold at Hope,
or even at Kingsbridge; once, in some sort, the
metropolis of its brewing. But we need not
regret the disappearance of this heady nastiness,
which was not in the least like ale, and more nearly
resembled that extremely potent and convivial
compound, “egg-flip,” than anything else. But
“White Ale” had a great and an ancient reputation,
and was described a couple of centuries
ago as “the nappiest ale that can be drunk.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
It was held to be the “ancient and peculiar drink
of the Britons and Englishmen, and the wholesomest,
whereby many in elder times lived a
hundred years.”</p>

<p>If we can frame to believe that, then the
disappearance of it is something like a national
disaster; but it may well be supposed that although
the numbers of police-court cases would
sensibly increase with the re-introduction of
“White Ale,” those of centenarians would not.
The composition of this tipple, which is really
grey, seems to be milk, gin, and spice, and, bottled,
it blows off in hot weather like a high-pressure
boiler.</p>

<span class="smaller">THURLESTONE—THE AVON—BOROUGH ISLAND—RINGMORE—KINGSTON—THE
ERME</span></h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus62">
<img src="images/illus62.jpg" width="400" height="150" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE THURLESTONE.</p>
</div>

<p>The little headland enclosing the western side of
Hope Cove forms the eastern horn of Thurlestone
Bay, and as you rise the neck of land dividing
the two, you see the strange rock with the hole
through it—the Thurlestone—which gives a name,
not only to the sandy bay, but to the village of
Thurlestone, which stands with its ancient church
on the bare hillsides beyond. The Thurlestone,
is a mass of red conglomerate, oddly isolated amid
the neighbouring slate, standing in deep water,
surrounded by a group of small satellite rocks and
reefs, and derives its name from the Anglo-Saxon,
“thyrlian,” to pierce. It is thus “the drilled,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
or pierced stone, and claims philological kin with
“nostril,” or nose-hole, and “thrall,” a slave
whose ear has been pierced. That standby of
topographers, the Domesday Book, calls the
village “Torlestan,” which is as near as the
Norman-French scribe could arrive at the sound
of the Saxon word. My own respect for the
Thurlestone is considerably heightened by this
evidence of its having worn, a thousand years
ago, very much the same appearance it does now.
Curiously enough, there is a Thirlestane Castle
in Scotland.</p>

<p>When the south-westerly winds bring great
seas raging into the bay, with towering white
combers dashing in upon the sands, the Thurlestone
finds a voice and calls with a sound of roaring,
all over this countryside. The rustics say that
at such times you shall hear the bellowing of the
Thurlestone ten miles distant.</p>

<p>For myself, I have come to Thurlestone at a
time when there are no voices, save the cat-like
screaming of the gulls and the horrible squawking
noises of the cruiser setting out to sea from Hope
Cove, and bidding a series of half-suffocated
good-byes with her steam-whistles, dreadfully
like some one being very offensively sick. Noises
are not common on Thurlestone strand, and I
would even say it was lonely, save that the
millions of sand-fleas inhabiting the shore forbid
the thought.</p>

<p>I have bought a piece of Dutch cheese and
some biscuits, and disregarding the inmates of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the one hideously plastered boarding-house recently
built here, take off shoes and stockings,
and sitting on a convenient rock sliding down
into deep water, come into intimate touch with
the infinities, and make these notes. Two pennyworth
of Dutch cheese, with biscuits to match,
a comfortable seat on a rocky ledge, your feet
dabbling in the clear water, and sunshine over
all, will bring you into close relation with the
Infinite. Here I hew off in the rough a slab of
the Simple Life, and enjoy it hugely. It is, I
suppose, the sunshine and the solitude in collaboration.
At any rate, it is obviously enough not the
white ale.</p>

<p>There are cornelians and lovely pebbles on
this lonely strand, and sea-anemones, to the eye
appetisingly like fruit-jellies, on the rocks. Alas!
they are <i>not</i> good to eat, and as fairy gold, we
all know, turns to sere leaves, so the translucent
pebbles of the wet sea-shore become the commonplace
opaque stones that the next day we turn
disgustedly out of our pockets. In short, it is
life in little you find reflected here, and reduces
the heady optimism of a summer noon to something
like tears. I don’t expect, or hope, every one
who comes to this salt margin of Devon will feel
thus. This it is to be cursed with temperament,
to be, against your will, a snivelling sentimentalist,
whom the lowing of the cattle at eventide, the
distant tinkling of the sheep-bells, or the very
beauty of day or place will suffice to reduce to a
chastened melancholy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>Thurlestone church is neighboured on the
hillside in these expansive times by a golf club,
which, in the interest of golf-balls, has actually
had the impudence to spread wire-netting over
the charming little rustic stream that here flows
to the sea; and near by are the ornate brand-new
villas built and furnished by speculators with
an eye on the possible huge profits to be earned
from letting them for the summer season, in these
times of a revived appreciation of the countryside.
It is with a malignant joy that the wayfarer
perceives the speculators to have overreached
themselves, and the villas—“white elephants”
says the ferryman at Bantham—to be unlet.
How, indeed, should Thurlestone become a place
of resort? It is remote, and its sands, unstable
and shelving steeply to the sea, are extremely
dangerous.</p>

<p>The dark, stern, upstanding Perpendicular
tower of the old church looks down grimly
upon these white and red and yellow upstarts.
It is a fine, large church, the successor of an
earlier, as the great Norman bowl-font of red
sandstone would seem to prove, and the designers
of it designed in a fine, large, broad style, suited to
the coarse-grained granite and limestone of their
building-materials. That Rev. Mr. John Snell,
chaplain to Charles I., who was with the Royalist
garrison in Salcombe Castle, was rector here, and
although one of the articles of surrender declared
that he was not to be disturbed in his living, he
was plundered of his goods, and his farm-stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
was twice carried off by the Puritans, so that
he found it prudent to leave. Unlike so many
others, he lived to return to his parish, and, I have
no doubt, rendered things in his turn, extremely
uncomfortable for some. One little natural human
touch of him remains, in the entry in the register
under his hand, against the years covered by the
Commonwealth:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent3">“<i>Monstrum horrendum informe</i>,”</div>
<div class="verse indent3">Horrible and shapeless monster.</div>
<div class="verse">“This is youre houre and ye power of darkness.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The iron had evidently entered into his soul.</p>

<p>The interior of the church has of late been
exquisitely decorated and repaired: we will not
say “restored,” for that word is rightly of ill-savour
in these times. In place of the almost
inevitable pitch-pine pews, or the commonplace
chairs, there are green-stained, rush-bottomed
chairs, with woodwork of the same hue: all very
artistic and delightful, and sufficing to show that
the more usual order of things is less inevitable
than might be supposed, and only so common
because taste is a quality of the rarest. Only,
I would that these things did not so commonly
go with that new reforming zeal which is sending
the Church of England Romewards, so fast as
its clergy dare. Here a faculty has been obtained
for a rood-screen, and in general things are
developing at a rate dangerous to that new
movement itself and bringing that counter-reformation
which is presently to repeat history.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
History, it is true, does repeat itself, but not on
precisely identical lines, and the newer Reformation
will be the disestablishment and disendowment
of an unworthy Church, and free-trade in
religion.</p>

<p>There are weird rocks out beyond Thurlestone,
on the coastwise route round to the Avon estuary;
one of them—it may be glimpsed in the background
of the Thurlestone illustration—resembling
some monstrous growth of the mushroom kind.
The direct way to the crossing of the Avon is
through Thurlestone street, and thence by the
hillside village of Buckland, and by Bantham, a
hamlet nestling under the lee of the Ham, a great
sandy elbow thrown up, ages ago, by the sea
and the winds, in vain efforts to fling back the
Avon upon itself. That river is no rushing torrent,
but just a softly gliding stream; and the sand
dunes have not sufficed to imprison it. All they
have done is to turn its course aside, due west
instead of south, and there, denied a direct access
to the sea, it has eaten away the cliffs in a great
semicircular mouthful, and goes gliding out to
the Channel through a waste of flat sands.</p>

<p>It was here in 1772 that the <i>Chanteloupe</i>,
homeward-bound from the West Indies, was totally
wrecked, and of all those on board only one person
saved. Those were the times when the fisherfolk
and shore-dwellers generally prayed for wrecks,
and if none was forthcoming, helped Providence
to produce them by exhibiting false lights on
shore, to lure vessels to their doom. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
thought no shame of asking, “O Lord, give us
a good wreck,” and were perhaps very little more
civilised than the savages of strange lands, who,
thinking shipwrecked sailors, to have been shipwrecked
at all, must be under the high displeasure
of the gods, murder them out of hand, and consider
themselves, in so doing, the vicars of those
affronted deities.</p>

<p>“A good wreck,” especially if there were no
survivors left to tell the tale, or to claim anything,
would keep the seaboard of half a county in
luxury of sorts for quite a considerable time,
and as survivors were such detrimentals, they
were, in those “good old times,” very quickly
made not to survive. It was a rude, but practical
application of that Socialistic doctrine of collectivism,
of which we hear so much nowadays,
“the greatest good to the greatest number.”</p>

<p>The story of the <i>Chanteloupe</i> is a dark and
repellent instance of those practices. It narrates
how a lady named Burke, familiar with the evil
reputation of these people, and fearful of being
murdered, put on all her jewellery when the
ship struck, and was flung ashore glittering with
precious stones. If she had thought to purchase
life with that display, she made the most fatal
of errors, for the sight only served to arouse the
worst passions of those beach-combers, who
slaughtered the unfortunate woman for the sake
of her rings and other trinkets. When enquiries
were set afoot, her body was discovered in the
sands, bloodstained, with fingers cut off and ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
mutilated; but it does not appear that the guilt
was brought home to any one. The fisherfolk,
doubtless, all hung together, lest they should hang
separately.</p>

<p>Two years earlier a local Quaker, one Henry
Hingeston, had published a pamphlet denouncing
the wrecking propensities of this coast:</p>

<p>“I have been deeply affected,” said he, “to
see and feel how sweet the report of a <i>shipwreck</i>
is to the inhabitants of this country, as well
professors as prophane, and what running there
is on such occasions, all other business thrown
aside, and away to wreck. … I am verily persuaded
that it hath been more sweet to hear that
all the men are drowned, and so a ‘proper wreck,’
than that any are saved, and by that means hinder
their more public appearance on that stage for
getting money. O! the cruelty that hath been
acted by many. My heart hath been often heavy
to consider it, insomuch that I think multitudes
of heathen are nothing near so bad. Remember
the broadcloth slupe, stranded in Bigbury Bay,
richly laden. O! for shame, for shame, I am
really vext that ever my countrymen should be
guilty of such devilish actions.”</p>

<p>But the estimable Hingeston might just as
effectively have preached to the gulls and the
cormorants on the iniquity of catching fish, as
to have denounced wrecking. ’Twas in the blood,
and that is all there is to it.</p>

<p>These old tales of long-vanished days seem
very remote and indistinct, but they came very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
near and vivid when a few years ago some children
digging in the sand of the Ham, turned up a skull,
pronounced to be that of a negro. It was considered,
together with heaps of bones afterwards
discovered, to be a relic of the tragedy of the
<i>Chanteloupe</i>.</p>

<p>The Devonshire folk—the rustic sort, at any
rate—generally call their Avon the “Aune,” and
a little hamlet not far from this same Bantham
is “Aunemouth;” while the village of Aveton
Gifford, standing up-river, where the salt estuary
becomes a freshwater stream, is impartially
“Aveyton,” or “Auton,” “Jifford.”</p>

<p>At Bantham Ferry the boatman puts you
across for twopence, or however much or little
he thinks you will stand—and it is only the matter
of a dozen strokes at low water. And then you
have the sands, the loose stones, and the rustling
bennets and the sedges all to yourself; a kind of
seashore Sahara. Then you round a rocky point;
and there before you is Burr Island, a majestic
reek of acetylene, or other gas, and people.
Wide stretch the sands at ebb, but they are not so
wide but that the prints of footsteps have disfigured
them pretty thoroughly; for where the
land slopes down to the shore in grassy fields, the
Plymouth people have built bungalows, and are
building more. Burr, or Borough, Island is
tethered to the mainland at ebb by this nexus of
sand. It is in this circumstance a kind of minor
St. Michael’s Mount, and like it again in that it
once owned a chapel dedicated to St. Michael.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
The chapel disappeared in the lang syne, and when
the solitary public-house—whose deserted roof-tree
may still be seen—ceased business, civilisation
and Borough Island wholly parted company.</p>

<p>Beyond this point is the little sand-smothered
bight of Challaborough, with a coastguard station,
where this explorer, at least, met coastguards of
exceptional stupidity and astonishing ignorance
of the coast beyond their own insignificant nook.
Why, they could not even spell or pronounce the
name of their own station properly, and made it
“Shellaborough.” “Erme Mouth?” they had
never heard of it, nor of the Erme River, but
dimly conceived “Muddycombe,” to be meant.
And as for the coast, they spoke of it in such awestruck
terms that (it shall be confessed) the time
drawing on towards evening, I made inland, and
so do not know’ what manner of dragons and
chimeras those are, which no doubt inhabit the
three miles and a half of a not very rugged
shore, awaiting the advent of a fine juicy tourist.</p>

<p>Primitive, indeed, are those villages that lie
away back from the sea in these parts. First
comes Kingmore, where the rock outcrops from
the macadam in the main road, where the cottages
are half-smothered in flowers, and where the
domestic fowls that squatter and plunge in dust-baths
in the middle of the street are the only
signs of life. Reminiscences of the old window-tax
are called up by a house with a walled-up
window, carefully painted with a pretence of being
a genuine one of panes and sashes. Even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
brass catch has not been forgotten by the artist
in illusion, whose treatment is so literal, he must
have been the forerunner of the Newlyn School.
The brass catch is rendered more than a thought
too brassy, and the unfortunately painted panes
are by no means convincing. But the deception
although so grotesquely obvious, could not, under
such opaque circumstances, be called transparent,
could it?</p>

<p>Like the Reverend Mr. Snell of Thurlestone,
William Lane, rector of Ringmore, was a militant
Royalist. He raised and trained a company of
men and, laying hands upon some cannon, opened
out a battery against the Parliamentary forces
on their way to the leaguer of Salcombe. His
exploit made him a marked man, and he was
considered sufficiently important for an expedition
to be sent against him by sea from the Parliamentary
stronghold of Plymouth. The orders
given the commander of this force were to capture
and shoot the combatant cleric; but Mr. Lane,
advised of what was afoot, took refuge in the tower
of his church, where the secret room, provided
with a fireplace, in which he hid is still to be seen.
Here he lay three months, fed by his faithful
parishioners, but was at last obliged to escape to
France. At last, venturing to return, he worked
for awhile as a labourer in the limestone quarries
near Torquay, until his little dwelling was pillaged
by a French privateer. He died at last when on
his return from London, whither he had journeyed
on foot to ventilate his grievances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>The ancient church of Ringmore contains a
relic of more recent strife, in the shape of an icon
from Sebastopol.</p>

<p>At Kingston, on the way across to the river
Erme, there is but one inn. The “Sloop” is the
name of it, and there, if you wait half-an-hour,
while the cocks and hens run in and out of the
rooms and passages, they will get you tea. There
is very little of a Lyons’ or other tea-shop about
the “Sloop.” And Kingston village is to match;
primitive Devonian in style, which is a style partaking
of all the characteristics belonging to the
untamed villages of Cornwall, Ireland, and the
Highlands of Scotland. There are very few of
the type left now, which is a cause for thankfulness,
or regret, as you will, and they ought to be
preserved on ice and kept for the admiration, or
otherwise, of posterity.</p>

<p>Out of Kingston the road runs deep down
below the level of the fields, in true Devonshire
sort, with high banks and tall hedges on either
side, so that no view is possible. Nor would it
have mattered had it been otherwise when this
Stanley of these remote parts passed this way,
for the whole face of the land and sea and the
blue of the sky was blotted out on this warm and
close evening of a hot summer’s day by a white
pillowy fog, which, the nearer the shore, grew
more dense.</p>

<p>After long tramping comes a left-hand turn,
with a signpost inscribed “Mothecombe.” The
name suggests some moth-eaten hamlet that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
would be all the better for plenty of camphor and
a good airing; but presently one realises that <i>this</i> is
the place called by the coastguards “Muddycombe,”
and more usually, in local speech, “Muthycombe.”</p>

<p>It is a solitary road that leads down from this
signpost, and the fog discloses only one person
on the way: a boy, driving a cow. “Coom oop,
Primrose,” says he, and that mild-featured dame
and he turn into a field, the whiteness engulfs
them at once, and the wayfarer is alone in the
world.</p>

<p>Suddenly the road ends, upon a sandflat.
This is really the mouth of the Erme, the estuary
where it slides out to sea, but it is infinitely mysterious
in this smother of fog and woolly silence.
The stranger, of course, assumes a village from
the direction of that curt, staccato signpost up
the road, but devil a house can he find here; only
a something looming out from under low cliffs,
which at first he takes to be an inn, and then a
blockhouse fort, resolving itself finally into the
inhospitable likeness of a ruined limekiln.</p>

<p>The distant rustle and whispering of waves
on the sea-shore comes fitfully through the fog,
which breaks mysteriously and shows the river,
with occasional glimpses of the woody banks
opposite. For the rest, all is silence, save for
an odd continuous buzzing or sizzling undertone,
like bacon-frying, <i>piano</i>. It is marvellously like,
and only the smell is wanting to complete the
illusion, which is produced by the billions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
sand-fleas living their little crowded hour in the
sands and among the drying seaweed. Every
time you kick over a tuft of weed you disturb a
little world, and rouse that frying-bacon sound,
as though a rasher had been turned in the frying-pan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the way is obviously across that
river, but how to win to that other side? No one,
nor any house, is in sight, but here, by fortunate
chance, is a fisherman’s boat, and I up-anchor,
cast off, and row myself to the opposite shore,
expectant all the while of an angry shout from
somewhere. But anything, rather than stay the
night over yonder with the sand-fleas. No one,
however, witnessed that little act of piracy, and
I walked up out of that steamy laundry-like
hollow, where one is reduced to the limpness of
washing hung over a clothes-line, and wondered
what yon fisherman said and thought when he
found himself on the one side of the river and his
boat on the other. I hope it is not many miles
round to the first bridge, or ford.</p>

<p>Mothecombe is a place where explorers and
visitors of any kind are severely discouraged, the
local landowners, the Mildmays of Flete, a magnificent
modern mansion whose park extends for
several miles along the Erme and the Pamflete
creek, having abolished the inns, while their
tenants dare harbour no such chancey thing as a
stranger. It seems rather mediæval. Far from
being aggrieved at this, the chance wayfarer is
so impressed that he is only too grateful to be
allowed to live, instead of being shot at sight.
It is, in any case, a difficult matter to explore the
coast at beautiful Mothecombe, for the summer
atmosphere is that of a stewpot, and merely to
gently walk the shortest distance bathes one in
perspiration. The only thing to do is to enquire
the way to Revelstoke, the next place marked
on the map, and to make for it under as easy
conditions as may be.</p>

<p class="caption">THE RUINED CHURCH OF REVELSTOKE.</p>
</div>

<p>When at last, after leaving inhospitable Mothecombe,
the explorer comes to Revelstoke, whose
name, at any rate, promises something better, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
finds himself in rather worse case, and understands
why it was the country-people, even within a few
miles of it, put their heads together and consulted
with one another so deeply, and with so little
result. For, beyond a ruined church, solitary on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the verge of the cliffs, and at the end of a tangled
footpath, overgrown with brambles and nettles,
there is <i>no</i> Revelstoke at all, and the hospitality
foreshadowed by its name is seen to be a thing
impossible. It is a very pleasant and romantic
place to come to on a bright summer’s morning,
but to come strange to it at night——! Praise
be to the powers that took me, after Mothecombe,
inland to Holbeton instead.</p>

<p>This ruined church of St. Peter, near Stoke
Point, nearly overhangs the cliffs of a rocky inlet,
but the building itself is so shrouded with ivy,
even to the apex of its saddle-backed roof, that
it is almost reduced to terms of vegetation, and
is, moreover, so overhung with trees that neither
from the sea nor from any distance inland is it
visible.</p>

<p>The nice taste generally exhibited by newly
ennobled personages in their selection of titles
is worthy of all praise. When Edward Charles
Baring was created a baron, in 1885, he had a
choice, among his surrounding properties, of such
names as Membland, Battisborough, Noss, Newton,
and Worsewell. Noss and Worsewell, I should
think, were, on the score of euphony, quite out of
the question. But—in the phrasing of the newest
slang—what was wrong with Membland, Newton,
or Battisborough? Nothing at all; but there
is doubtless a something about the sound of
Revelstoke that suggests aristocratic devilry and
high jinks, infinitely pleasing. Not that the name
necessarily signifies anything of the kind, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the Middle-English meaning of “revel” was not
so much a jollification as a disturbance; which
seems to have been the inevitable result of those
ancient drinking-bouts. The “Revel” of this
place-name is said to derive from <i>reafful</i>, meaning
rapacious. The place, according to this view,
is christened after some early <i>reafere</i>, rover, or
robber, a progenitor, possibly of that “Sir Ralph
(or Rafe) the Rover,” familiar to us in the poem
of the Inchcape Rock, off the coast of Scotland;
and the “Stoke” was his stockade, the defence
of his robber’s lair. Who this robbing rover was—or
who they were, for there must needs have been
a band of them—there can be little doubt. They
were an isolated party of the marauding Danes
or vikings of the ninth century, whose main body
was defeated in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 851 at Wembury.</p>

<p>There is no difficulty raised against the pedestrian
following the private drive made by Lord
Revelstoke round the coast. In this manner the
great piled-up slabs of rock forming Stoke Point
can be seen, with Yealm Head and the woodlands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
on the way. But most pilgrims who have already
made a long walk of it will undoubtedly feel
disposed to cut that detour out and make for
the modern church of Revelstoke inland, overlooking
a creek of the deep sea-channel of the
Yealm and the villages of Noss Mayo and Newton
Ferrers. “Newton” and “Noss” those villages
are familiarly styled. They confront one another
like Putney and Fulham across the Thames, the
old church of Newton Ferrers in outline the
fellow of the new one of Revelstoke. But the new
building is the veriest upstart. It was built by
Lord Revelstoke in 1882, at a cost of £29,000,
and is a very prominent example of great cost,
much pretension, and little real art. Less of
the ecclesiastical furnishers’ work and more solid,
if less showy, fittings would have made the church
more worthy its beautiful site. That riches take
to themselves wings is exemplified here; for in
less than ten years from the completion of this
church and the ornate rebuilding of Membland
Hall, came the great Baring financial crash, and
with it the impoverishment of Lord Revelstoke.</p>

<p>The Yealm runs up, as a deep, narrow and
beautiful salt estuary for some three miles inland,
and excursion steamers from Plymouth penetrate
so far as Steer Point, where Kitley and Coffleet
creeks branch right and left to Yealmpton—“Yampton”
locally—and Brixton, and in the
middle the smaller creek of Puslinch. The fresh
water stream of the Yealm, like all the streams
of South Devon, comes from Dartmoor. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
banks of the estuary are deeply wooded and extremely
picturesque; presenting, more than any
of those numerous inlets that are so notable a
feature of this coast, the appearance of a gorge;
Noss Mayo standing on its branch creek, deriving,
indeed, the first part of its name from the projecting
height—the “ness” or “nose”—on which
it stands. Noss in 1849 suffered terribly from
cholera, and even more terribly two centuries
ago, when only seven of its inhabitants survived.</p>

<p>By the row-boat ferry at Yealm Mouth the
explorer is put to the tiring scramble towards
Wembury. Descending the hillside fields of corn,
the lonely church is seen, and over it, out to sea,
the famous Mewstone appears, rising, a huge,
abrupt and angular mass of dark limestone rock,
a mile off-shore. Dangerous, and nearly inaccessible
though it be at most times, it and its
surrounding sea look so innocent and harmless
under the sun of a still day in July that the evil
reputation of that rock and these waters seems
based on insubstantial grounds. Yet the Mewstone
has amply occasioned the poetic tribute:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The sullen crash, the shriek of wild despair,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">One moment swell the gust that whistles by;</div>
<div class="verse">The next—no sound of living voice is there,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">None, save the waken’d sea-mew’s dreary cry.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The verse points to the origin of the name of
this and the several other Mewstones along this
coast of Devon; the sea-mew is of course the
sea-gull, and these isolated reefs so many “sea-gull
rocks.” References are often found in literature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
to the “laughter of the gulls,” but the name
of “sea-mew” more nearly indicates the sound
of the peevish cry of those birds, which closely
resembles the mew of a cat.</p>

<p>About 1836 the Mewstone was inhabited by
one Samuel Wakeham and his wife, who lived
in a little rustic house and looked after Squire
Calmady’s rabbits, which swarmed the seemingly
lifeless rock. The Mewstone was made the subject
of an article in a local South Devon magazine,
and (according to the editor of it) drew the annexed
reply from the “Lord of the Isles,” as the
editor calls him. The thing is amusing, but
smells suspiciously like an editorial invention:</p>

<p>There is no village at Wembury; only, down
beneath the swelling contours of those hillside
cornfields, a church, a farmstead, and a water-mill
on the very verge of the beach: the whole
so situated and of such a singularly unnatural
loneliness and air of detachment that you feel sure
whatever history may have to say of the place, or
whatever it may leave unsaid—you feel sure,
I say, that the sea has at some time come up and
munched off a great piece of land and the village
with it, and has long ago digested the whole.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
And indeed what is left of Wembury is situated
in a little semi-circular bay, where the downs
descend to low clifflets of friable earthy rock,
which is now slaty, now gravelly, and again of
the red Devonian sandstone, all by turns. It is
as though that hungry sea had come suddenly
and taken a mouthful, as you might bite a piece of
bread and butter.</p>

<p>Descending to this strange spot, you look down
upon the leads of the church tower and thence
come by rough and steep tracks to the shore, where
a little stream runs by the water-wheel of the
old mill on to the shingle of the beach. So near
is the wheel to the sea that in times of storm
the salt water of the waves mingles with the
fresh, and so close to the tide are the walls of the
mill-house that when the winds lash the waters
into foaming breakers the rooms smell of the
salt spray, and are filled with the clamour of the
elements.</p>

<p>Here the singular picturesqueness of the
place is most fully revealed, and the church to
which just now you descended is seen to stand
high and boldly above the beach, on a commanding
knoll, girt about with a circular brick retaining-wall
heavily buttressed, lest it, as well
as the church, and the churchyard it shores up
from a sudden descent, should come toppling
down in common ruin.</p>

<p>The age, the rugged beauty, and the interest
of the church are almost completely hidden beneath
a coating of plaster, and the grass grows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
rankly in the churchyard, where the odd epitaph
may be noted:</p>

<p class="center">Henry Kembil<br />
died Nov. 25 1725<br />
’Tis over with your friend<br />
Mind That.</p>

<p>An arresting inscription, surely, and not a
little puzzling until it is discovered that Henry
Kembil was a ferryman of the Yealm and a portion
of his epitaph is a play upon the word “over,”
by which, shouting across the river, the would-be
passenger who is versed in Devon ways still brings
the ferryman to him.</p>

<p>Save, indeed, for the hullabaloo created by the
battleships out to sea and the forts off Plymouth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
practising their heavy guns, Wembury would
scarce be associated with bloody war; yet if this
place is really the “Wicganbeorch” of the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle—as by antiquaries it is supposed
to be—it saw particularly hard fighting in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 851,
when “Ceorl the Ealdorman, with the men of
Devon fought against the heathen men (that is,
the Danes), and there made great slaughter and
got the victory.”</p>

<p>Those “heathen” men or Danes were the
vikings, of whom early history has so much to
tell; but here we see the Anglo-Saxon chronicler,
in writing “Wicganbeorch,” which means Wiking-bury—adopting
the advice given so many centuries
later by Tony Weller to his dutiful Sam, and
“spelling it with a ‘we.’”</p>

<p>The big gun practice of the battleships out in
the Channel, whose roaring is like that of several
thunderstorms growling in concert across the
water, is very impressive, and majestic, and altogether
different from the sound of firing from the
forts, producing a less resonant noise, like that
of rude and impudent persons, very much out of
temper, violently and continually slamming doors.</p>

<p>Oh! it is good to stand on the beach of a primitive
place like Wembury when the sea breeze
blows in strong, and the great curling waves come
creaming up to the very walls of the mill-house,
with the stinging salt particles on your face and
an unutterable sense of vitality and freedom
clothing you, and the giant waves spouting out
yonder on the Mewstone, and the hoarse jamboree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
of the great guns bellowing yonder. But when the
sea and the air are still and the August sun glares
down upon the hilly coast, why then there is
nothing for it but to either rest till sundown or
plod on exhaustedly in a reeking moist heat,
welcoming every little puff of wind on the rises,
and almost sinking to the ground in the stew-pan
of the hollows.</p>

<p>Distances in and around Plymouth are most
remarkably deceptive, and the local geography is
full of surprises. The famous Plymouth Sound
is from two to four miles wide, but the clear air
and the heights on either side give an impression
of smaller scale. As you round the hilly coast
from Wembury and come within the Sound, you
enter upon a panoramic scene, where the great
Breakwater, itself nearly a mile and a half long,
with a sea-passage on the hither side of a mile’s
breadth, rests upon the blue waters like some
pigmy undertaking, and the ironclads seem quite
trivial. The ordinary vision is altogether at fault
at Plymouth, and requires careful adjustment
to an unfamiliar scale of things; and in the meanwhile
the stranger, walking round the coast,
discovers that in tramping these last miles the
way is quite twice as long as it seems. Plymouth
town lies distinctly in sight, but you seem for a
long while never to approach any nearer, and
meanwhile you tramp up coastguard paths and
down, and round into coves and still more round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
headlands, gradually coming within the area of
War Department activities; where old forts and
middle-aged forts, and forts still in the making
astonish the rabbits. The outstanding features
of garrison towns are grittiness, barrenness, and
glare, served up in squalor; and military strength
is generally made to look silly by clothes-lines
fluttering signals of washing day over the embrasures
and the dry moats. Approaching Plymouth
therefore by Bovisand and Staddon Forts, the
heat and the glare make the very brains ferment
in your head, the grit scarifies your feet, and the
sordid garrison details, and then the slumminess
of Turnchapel sear your very soul. But in
between, there are some jewelled nooks: the green
valley and woods of Bovisand and little unexpected
baylets, with tiny sands that you look down upon
suddenly, shamefacedly surprising young ladies
bathing in a costume of little more than nothing,
supplemented thinly by their native modesty,
and piquantly surmounted with picture-hats. Convention
would require them to be embarrassed,
but the startled pedestrian’s blushes and the
nymphs’ comparative unconcern outrange the
expected feelings of the situation.</p>

<p>At Turnchapel the ferry steamer takes the
wearied exerciser upon Shanks’s Mare across the
Catwater to Phœnix Wharf and the old original
Plymouth, adjoining the Barbican and Sutton
Pool.</p>

the Plym, but its original name was the Cad,
and Plymouth was originally “Sutton”: still
known as “Sutton-on-Plym.” It is found under
this name in Domesday Book. The name Catwater,
or Cattewater, as it is also spelled, may be
a survival of the original name of the river, as well
as being one of the numerous stretches of water
with this prefix: the Cattegat, <i>i.e.</i>, the “narrow
gate,” at the entrance of the Baltic; Catford, near
London, Catawade, on the river Stour, near Manningtree;
all with the same meaning of narrowness.</p>

<p>There is some ground for supposing that the
original name of Plymouth, or a portion of the
vast site now occupied by the Three Towns of
Plymouth, Devonport and Stonehouse, was in
Saxon times “Tamarweorth,” and the present
name only begins to figure in ancient documents
of the mid-thirteenth century, in a tentative way,
as “Sutton-super-Plymouth.” After that period
it gradually rose to importance, being first represented
in Parliament in 1298. Sutton Pool, the
innermost basin of Plymouth, the old original
harbour, and still the place to which the fishing
smacks and many of the local steamers come,
is bordered by the ancient quays and the queer
old houses of the Barbican, once a district inhabited
by merchant princes, but now pre-eminently “Old
Plymouth,” and although exceedingly picturesque,
scarcely a residential quarter. The Barbican took
its name originally from the castle, now the citadel,
which guarded the narrow entrance to Sutton
Pool, across which was stretched every night, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the time of Henry the Eighth, a protective chain.
From these defences the existing arms of Plymouth,
four black castles between a green saltire, are
said to derive. The pious motto of the town is
<i>Tunis fortissima est nomen Jehovah</i>, but at the
same time Plymouth is very strongly fortified in
the military way.</p>

<p class="caption">THE BARBICAN: WHERE
THE PILGRIM FATHERS EMBARKED.</p>
</div>

<p>Certain very definite and picturesque scenes
arise out of the dim abysmal, grey and confused
rag-bag of history here in this fishy Barbican.
Most definite of all the last farewell to England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
of the Pilgrim Fathers in 1620. On the pavement,
by the quay, is a modest stone, inscribed, “Mayflower,”
with the date; and near at hand, let into
a wall, a less modest commemorative bronze
tablet, with this inscription:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On the 6th of September, 1620, in the Mayoralty of Thomas
Fownes, after being “kindly entertained and courteously used by
divers Friends there dwelling,” the Pilgrim Fathers sailed from
Plymouth in the <span class="smcap">Mayflower</span> in the Providence of God to settle
in <span class="smcap">New Plymouth</span>, and to lay the Foundation of the <span class="smcap">New
England States</span>. The ancient Cawsey whence they embarked
was destroyed not many years afterwards, but the Site of their
Embarkation is marked by the Stone bearing the name of
the <span class="smcap">Mayflower</span> in the pavement of the adjacent Pier. This
Tablet was erected in the Mayoralty of J. T. Bond, 1891,
to commemorate their Departure, and the visit to Plymouth
in July of that Year of a number of their Descendants and
Representatives.”</p>

</div>

<p>There were forty-eight men and fifty-three
women and children in this little band, and the
voyage occupied sixty days.</p>

<p>The spot means much to Americans, for here
the handful of emigrants for conscience’ sake
definitely cast adrift from their native land, which
denied them religious liberty, and made oversea
to the coast of Massachusetts, there to found a
nation anew. The little <i>Mayflower</i> had sailed
originally from Boston, in Lincolnshire, and bade
farewell to old England from the coast of Devon;
and thus it seemed fitting to those stern voluntary
outcasts that they should—still fondly looking
back to their motherland—name their landing-place
in the new world “Plymouth Rock,” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the earliest among their settlements “Boston.”
There was, therefore, an exquisite fitness in the
circumstance that it was into this Boston harbour
in America, a hundred and fifty-three years later,
that the colonists should fling the taxed tea, and
thus begin the struggle whence the dependent
New England colonies emerged as the sovereign
United States.</p>

<p>Our sympathies go out, historically, toward
those Pilgrim Fathers, but they would seem,
viewed closely, to have been not quite so lovable
as historic glamour makes them. Their religious
fervency was undoubted, but by all accounts it
made them ill to live with, and they would have
been greatly improved by a little sense of humour.
But then—it is a startling thought—if humour
had entered at all into their composition they had
never left their native shores at all, and the stern
principles which led them to refuse to acknowledge
James I. as head of the Church, and to expatriate
themselves when that shambling travesty of a
king declared that if they did not conform, the
country should not hold both, would have melted
into satiric laughter and an easygoing compliance.</p>

<p>But two autocrats may not reign side by side;
as easily might a soliloquy be conducted by two
or more persons; and a king with a fondness for
omniscience and absolutism, and a people whose
religious fervency had risen almost to the white
heat of fanaticism cannot abide together; hence
the voyage of the <i>Mayflower</i>, and this place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of pilgrimage for descendants of those New
Englanders.</p>

<p>The greatest point of vantage in all Plymouth
is the great open space beside the citadel.</p>

<p>It is the Hoe. What the Rialto was to Venice,
what the Hard to Portsmouth, the Sandhill to
Newcastle-on-Tyne, the Broomielaw to Glasgow,
that was the Hoe to Plymouth of old. From it,
let us never forget, on a memorable day of 1588,
the “Invincible” Armada was sighted; that
proud fleet which was to conquer England, and
place the foot of Spain upon our necks, and the
spiritual domination of the Pope of Rome over
our consciences. History tells us that the King
of Spain was not making that unprovoked attack
upon us which the simple legends of an earlier
and uncritical age would have us believe, and we
know that he was but seeking a very natural
revenge for the piracies Drake and others had
long practised upon his ships and foreign possessions;
both sides played the same lawless
game, only in those days Spain was the richer
country and her treasure galleons the easier prey.</p>

<p>How did Elizabeth’s captains await the coming
of the foe? Cheerily and calmly enough, though
their ships were few and small, and parsimony
at the fountain-head of State forbade the proper
measures being taken in the teeth of this long-threatened
danger. Stout hearts and ready seamanship,
aided by the providential tempest that
wrecked the stately ships of Spain, served our
turn, and Old England came victorious through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
that time of storm and stress, as she has since
come through many another, by favour of Providence
and through the handiwork of brave hearts
alone. Statesmanship and the proper preparations
of Government had been to seek, as they
commonly are. Was ever there another so happy-go-lucky—and
so lucky—a country?</p>

<p>I like—and all Englishmen must needs like—to
think of the proud spirit of that gallant company
of captains assembled upon the Hoe at their game
of bowls, when news of the Armada sighted off the
Lizard, and coming with the south-westerly wind
up Channel, gave them momentary pause. There
were gathered together Lord, Howard of Effingham,
the Lord High Admiral of England, and
with him were Drake, Hawkins, Frobisher, and
other great captains, among others of lesser
fame. It was like to be a crushing force that
was advancing toward our shores, for it numbered
no fewer than one hundred and thirty-five men-o’-war,
with crews of 8,000 men and 19,000
soldiers. But so confident were that gallant
company of their capacity to resist invasion that—so
the story from that time has run—on the
suggestion of Sir Francis Drake, who boldly
asserted that there was plenty time to finish
their game first and thrash the Spaniards afterwards,
they elected to complete their bout of
bowls.</p>

<p>I will not seek the authority upon which that
brave old tradition rests, and a malison, I say,
upon all who would whittle away our most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
cherished beliefs. Cold-blooded commentators
tell us that the famous expression, “The Old
Guard dies, but never surrenders,” was not
uttered, and declare, contrary from general belief,
that the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo never
said, “Up Guards, and at ’em!” and very likely
some one, somewhere, has made hash of the heart-stirring
tradition of Plymouth Hoe and claimed
to prove something craven and mean. Sufficient
for me, however, the story with which the Muse
of History has hitherto been content.</p>

<p>For centuries the memories of that soul-stirring
victory over the Invincible abode only in the
minds of Englishmen and between the covers
of history-books, but in these latter days, these
post-heroic days of criticism and commemoration,
when all the great men are dead and all the
great deeds done, and we have for some time
been engaged upon raising monuments to the
deeds and to the men who wrought them, or
criticising and explaining the why and the how
and the uses, or the uselessness it may be, of
those men and the work of their hands,—in these
latter days, I say, an Armada Memorial has
been set up upon the historic Hoe. It is a tall
pedestal, embellished with bronze plates and
medallions, and bearing the inscription, “He blew
with His winds and they were scattered,” and
with the virago figure of a helmeted Britannia
rushing in tempestuous petticoats, atop. Close
at hand is the statue of Sir Francis Drake, that
brilliant member of a brilliant group of Devonian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Elizabethans; one who, like Raleigh, in his
time played many parts, was foremost among
those scourges of Spain we bred in those spacious
days, pirate, filibuster, patriot, benefactor, and
the first to circumnavigate the globe. Little
wonder, then, that the name of Drake is honoured,
even yet, in Plymouth. They honour his memory
so jealously every year, at the Corporation visit
to the weirs, not because of his martial exploits
and the services he rendered the nation, but for
the benefit he conferred upon Plymouth by
bringing its water-supply from the inexhaustible
springs of Dartmoor; and thus, in piously exclaiming,
“May the descendants of him who
brought us water never want for wine,” the
Mayor sinks the repute of the Imperialist of the
Elizabethan age in that of the local benefactor.</p>

<p>The improving hand of modern times has
indeed improved away much of the outward and
visible romance of the Hoe, which, from the
rugged cliff-top common of Elizabeth’s time,
whence the great captains, roused from their
historic game of bowls, first glimpsed the dreaded
Armada, has been flattened out into trim lawns,
and provided with broad gravelled promenade
paths, like the veriest urban park or recreation
ground. All the forces that make for the commonplace
and the obvious have been let loose upon
the Hoe, and much of its highly picturesque
character has been lost under the treatment
of the surveyor and the landscape gardener.
But this historic spot can never be quite spoiled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
so long as it continues to look out upon Plymouth
Sound, and nothing less than a cataclysm of Nature
can alter that outlook.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus69">
<img src="images/illus69.jpg" width="400" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE CITADEL GATE.</p>
</div>

<p>Consider how exceptional the site. A hundred
and fifty feet above the sea, it looks straight out
to the Channel, three miles away, with the many
square miles of glorious Plymouth Sound in
between, enclosed to right and left by the wooded
heights of Mount Edgcumbe and the terraced hills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of Mount Batten and Bovisand. Drake’s Island,
immediately in front of the Hoe, and looking so
near, is a mile away, and at the distance of
another two miles is the famous Breakwater.
The Hoe thus stands at the head of one of the
finest harbours in the world: finest alike from
the seafaring and the picturesque points of view;
but it has yet another function—or had, in those
days before the giant ordnance of modern times
was dreamt of—for it is situated prominently
between the further inlets of the Catwater and
the Hamoaze, where, unsuspected by the ill-informed
enemies of other centuries, lay the
wealth of Plymouth. Then it was that the Citadel,
built upon the Hoe, was capable of challenging
the foe, wishful of sending exploratory keels up
the many creeks and estuaries that run in every
direction inland, like the spreading fingers of a
hand. The citadel is a fine, impressive piece of
late seventeenth-century work, and although it
was obsolete as a defence centuries ago, appeals
very strongly to the layman in fortification, to
whom battlements and castellated architecture
appeal more forcibly than the earthworks of
yonder forts semicircling the crescented hills,
from Staddon Heights and Bovisand in Devon,
to Tregantle and Screasdon in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Off the Hoe, in the most commanding position,
disputing, if need were, the entrance to Mill Bay,
the Catwater and the Hamoaze, is the great crag
now known as Drake’s Island. It is a kind of
islanded Gibraltar, a nest of forts and batteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
of a calibre not generally known, but reputed
immensely strong. Drake’s Island is not accessible
to the public, and like all mysteries, is looked
upon with awe. In the old days, when it was St.
Nicholas Island, the place made an ideal prison,
as regicides and recusants discovered in the reign
of Charles the Second.</p>

<p>That was a worthy and a noble idea by which
Smeaton’s old lighthouse-tower, superseded from
its watch and ward over the Eddystone, was
rebuilt on the Hoe in 1882. From the gallery
of it you may glimpse its successor, diminished
by the distance of fourteen miles to the semblance
of a tiny stalk rising lonely amidst the waste
of waters. It was no reflection upon the stability
of the tower that it was found necessary to remove
it, after it had safely weathered the storms of a
hundred and twenty years in that exposed situation.
It was the reef on which it stood that had
decayed. The interior of this wave-washed tower,
come ashore again after so many years, is open
to inspection, and there, around the cornice of
what was the store-room, you read the expression
of the piety of those who built, in the text, “Except
the Lord build the house, they labour in
vain that build it,” while above the lantern is the
further inscription, “24th August, 1759, <i>Laus
Deo</i>.”</p>

<p>Unhappily for the romantic associations of
the Hoe, fifth-rate and utterly unhistoric streets
and tramways conspire to render sordid the
immediate neighbourhood, and the place-name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
has itself been, time beyond the memory of man,
the sport of the H-less. It was H. J. Byron, the
dramatist, who made a crushing retort to an
actor, who, late for rehearsal, had excused himself
by saying he had been for a “walk round the
’oe.” “Next time,” said Byron, “don’t wander
so far. Take a stroll round the H.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE STORY OF THE EDDYSTONE—THE GUILDHALL—ST.
ANDREW’S</span></h2>

<p>Excursion steamers in summer take thousands
of visitors from the Hoe Pier out to the Eddystone,
and so in many minds renew the moving
story of that fatal reef. The existing lighthouse
is the fourth to be built in this terrible isolation,
whose loneliness appeals more to the imagination
when viewing the solitary tower in the hazy
distance, from the Hoe, than when it is seen at
close quarters. At a distance its puny proportions
in relation to the surrounding leagues of restless
sea are realised with a shudder at the temerity of
its builders, but near at hand the massive character
of its masonry is the first thing to attract attention.
If the daring of modern engineers inspires
respect, what should be those emotions with which
we look back upon the first audacious attempts
to rear a lighthouse upon the tiny foothold of
the exposed Eddystone, so far back as 1696?</p>

<p>It was early in 1665 that the first proposal
for lighting this dangerous reef, full in the course
of ships passing up or down Channel, was made;
Sir John Coryton and one Henry Brouncker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
petitioning the Duke of York, the then Lord
High Admiral, for permission to build a number
of lighthouses, and, incidentally, one on the Eddystone.
This proposal, referred to the Trinity
House, was eventually reduced to a scheme for
the Eddystone only, and the projectors, who were
not proposing to benefit mankind without a good
profit for themselves, were to be recouped their
outlay by a charge of 2<i>d.</i> a ton on foreign shipping
entering West Country ports: English vessels to
be free of charge.</p>

<p>Nothing more was ever heard of this early
project, but in 1692 one Walter Whitfield made
a bid for a patent from the Trinity House, by
which he was to be authorised, at his own risk,
to build a lighthouse, to reap the entire profits
for a term of three years, and one-half for the
next fifty years: the undertaking then to revert
to the Trinity House. A patent was granted
on these terms in 1694, but no works were initiated,
and even when a revised agreement was made in
1696, it was not Whitfield, but Winstanley, who
designed and built the first Eddystone Lighthouse.
Under this compact the projector’s term of full
profits was extended from three to five years.</p>

<p class="caption">WINSTANLEY’S EDDYSTONE LIGHTHOUSE.</p>
</div>

<p>Henry Winstanley was a singular genius:
very much of an artist, something, but not much,
of an engineer, and a wholly sanguine person.
He commenced operations on the rock on July 14th,
1696, his workmen being occupied all that summer
in drilling holes and fixing the iron stanchions
that were to support his building. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
he and his men slept on the rock itself, on other
occasions they were rowed at nightfall to the
guardship <i>Terrible</i>, which, lent by the Admiralty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
stood off and on all day. In June 1697, the
commander of this ship, one Commissioner St. Loe,
thought well to go off upon a wholly unauthorised
cruise for nearly a week, and in the meanwhile a
French privateer pounced upon Winstanley and
his men, took Winstanley prisoner and, taking
away the last stitch of the workmen’s clothing,
turned them adrift in their boat. To the credit
of the French government, Winstanley was speedily
released, and the too zealous captain of the privateer
seems to have been reprimanded for excess of
zeal; while St. Loe was peremptorily asked by the
Admiralty for an explanation of his conduct.
In the midsummer of 1698 Winstanley’s lighthouse
was completed and on November 14th, shed
the first warning gleam across the waters. It
was a remarkable structure. Rising to a height
of about eighty feet to its weather-vane, it
was fantastic in outline, beautiful in colour and
gilding, and adorned with devices of the sun
in splendour and the imposing inscriptions,
“<i>Pax in terra. Post tenebras lux. Glory be
to God.</i>” It was rather more picturesque than
even a Chinese pagoda, and offered so many
angles of resistance to the wind that we can only
marvel how the elements in those four years
allowed him to complete it, and then suffered it
to remain another three years. If picturesque
beauty were the sole consideration in lighthouse-building
this mingled stone and timber tower
with its strange suggestions of Wren’s City of
London church steeples and the “Queen Anne”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
architecture of Bedford Park, was surely the finest
lighthouse ever built. It proclaims itself in every
circumstance the work of an artist, and was to its
smallest detail unpractical. Winstanley even provided
a highly picturesque means of defence
against an enemy: a contrivance in an upper
gallery that would drop heavy stones upon his
boats; and he designed an elaborate room, from
which, in the picture, you see him fishing, and
apparently trying to hook one of the boat’s crew
pushing off from the rock.</p>

<p>Many of these ornate features were found to
be hazardous; the tower itself was not sufficiently
lofty, and alterations were made in 1699, by
which its height was increased to 120 feet. Remodelled,
it was, in Winstanley’s own opinion, as
safe as any castle ashore, and he expressed himself
as only too eager to be in his lighthouse when
the worst storm ever known was blowing. On
November 26th, 1703, he had his wish. He put
off from the Barbican at Plymouth for the Eddystone
on the afternoon of that day, when all the
signs pointed to an unprecedented tempest. That
night was the night of the famous storm that
levelled uncounted trees, unroofed and wrecked
many mansions, and sunk fleets of shipping.
Henry Winstanley was born at Littlebury, near
Saffron Walden, but he is not buried there, for
on that night he and his lighthouse and the lighthouse-keepers
perished together. When morning
dawned the rock was bare, except for one surviving
link of iron chain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Winstanley’s project had lost considerably
more than £3,000, and his widow was reduced to
seeking a pension from the Government; but
a singular fascination seems to have impelled
private persons to risk their all in a work that
should have been the sole concern of the Trinity
House. A certain John Lovett, merchant, of
London, was the next to enter this, as a commercial
project, and the designer of his lighthouse
was Rudyerd, a Ludgate Hill silk mercer. He
began work in 1706, and by 1709 had completed
a wooden tower, which lasted nearly fifty years, and
was then destroyed by fire, December 2nd, 1755.
There were three keepers. Their efforts at subduing
the flames were useless, the molten lead from
the roof driving them into the crannies of the rock;
where they went through such terrors of exposure
to the cold and the waves on the one hand,
and the cascades of melted lead on the other
that one, raving mad, plunged to death in the
sea. Two actually survived the occasion, but one
of these was thought a lunatic by the rescuing
party. He declared that while he stood looking
up at the flames, some molten lead had run down
his throat. In the course of twelve days he died,
and his incredible story was proved by nearly
eight ounces of lead being found in his stomach.
Incidentally, Lovett was ruined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>The third lighthouse was begun by the mortgagees
of Lovett’s estate, in June 1757. This
was the famous stone structure designed and
built by Smeaton. Although the building was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
hindered by Smeaton’s men being every now
and again seized by the Press Gang, it was
completed in October 1759, and would probably
still be standing except for the curious fact
that the rock it stood upon was showing signs
of weakness. In 1807 the building lease lapsed
and the lighthouse became the property of the
Trinity House, when the tallow candles, which,
up to that time had been the sole illuminant,
were exchanged for oil. A newer building, the
existing lighthouse, was decided upon in 1877,
and built on an adjoining reef. Begun in 1879,
it was completed in 1882. It is circular, constructed
of Cornish granite, and rises to a height
of 130 feet.</p>

<p>The streets of Plymouth and its sister towns
are a good deal more crowded than even those of
London. It is among the busiest of places, and
with its vast naval dockyards at Devonport and
Keyham, its military interests, and its great
commercial importance, is in a good many districts
grim and unlovely. The centre of Plymouth—the
municipal centre—is, however, strikingly
beautiful, and is the outcome of a movement
dating from about 1867, having for its object the
creation of a group of municipal buildings worthy
of a place with so long and stirring a history.
What the old Guildhall was like may still be seen,
for it survives in the dirty, dark and inconvenient
building thought good enough for the Public
Library, though not for the town Councillors. It
was a worthy and brilliant idea to build a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
group of Guildhall and offices for the governance
of the town; a majestic group that should harmonise
with the ancient Gothic church of St.
Andrew, and form with it three sides of a spacious
square. The opening of the Guildhall took place
in 1874, when the then Prince of Wales performed
the ceremony. The Great Hall, used for concerts
and public functions, is a noble building, with
fine hammerbeam roof, and an excellent range of
beautiful stained-glass windows, recounting in
spirited and well-coloured designs the Departure
from Plymouth for France of the Black Prince, in
1355; the Breton raid upon the town in 1404;
the enquiry at Plympton Priory as to the incorporation
of Plymouth, 1440; the Landing of Katharine
of Aragon, 1501; Captain Fleming announcing
the Armada in sight, 1588; Drake inaugurating
the Water Supply, 1592; the Arrest of Raleigh,

<p>The series ends with a window representing
the opening of the Guildhall itself, August 15th,
1874, by the Prince of Wales, who is shown in
stained-glass, taking part in the ceremony attired
in conventional silk hat, frock coat, and lavender-coloured
trousers. It is a weird and uncanny use
for stained-glass, and the thing is not less grotesque
because it thus perpetuates what now seems the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
ridiculous fashion in hats, coats, and trousers
obtaining in 1874. The Prince is shown holding a
wand, symbol of his then honorary office of High
Steward of the borough of Plymouth; within the
other hand the key used for the opening. In the
background of this highly remarkable
work of art, which would
certainly astonish the mediæval
craftsmen, could they return and
see it, are represented those who
strutted their little parts on the local
stage in that day. They are duly
pictured in their robes as Town
Councillors, and are happier in that
fact than the Prince is in his everyday
gear. Prominent among them
you see a face like a Dutch cheese
with whiskers; probably intended
for the mayor.</p>

<p>St. Andrew’s Church is a striking
feature in this group of municipal
buildings. It “suggested” the group:
it was the keynote whence this architectural
symphony was developed,
and in the continual modernising of
Plymouth, it remains one of the very
few old, and characteristic Devonian
buildings in the Three Towns. The
tower, built in 1460, is the latest part of the
church.</p>

<p>An odd punning epitaph within is worthy
a note. It is to the memory of one “Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Mary Sparke,” whose light was quenched in
1665:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Life’s but a Sparke, a weake uncertaine breath,</div>
<div class="verse">No sooner kindled but puft out by Death.</div>
<div class="verse">Such was my Name, my frame, my fate, yet I,</div>
<div class="verse">Am still a living Sparke, though thus I dye,</div>

<p>Plymouth’s other old church—although not
so very old—has a romantic story. It is one of
the four churches in England dedicated to “King
Charles the Martyr.” Begun in the reign of
Charles the First, it was abandoned during the
troubles that led to the execution of the king, and
was completed and dedicated in 1664.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE HAMOAZE—THE VICTUALLING YARD AND DOCKYARD—THE
TAMAR</span></h2>

<p>Undoubtedly the best way of obtaining the
fullest general idea of the size of Plymouth and its
satellite towns of Devonport and Stonehouse—to
say nothing of the newer towns of Stoke Damerel
and Morice Town—is to voyage by one of the
steamboats leaving the West Hoe Pier for Saltash.
You pass the Great Western Railway docks at
Mill Bay, and, rounding Devil’s Point—named
originally after an entirely harmless French Protestant
refugee, one Duval—come in sight of that
immense range of buildings, the Royal William
Victualling Yard. The particular Royal William
who gave his name to this establishment was
William the Fourth, whose great ugly statue in
granite, thirteen feet high, presides like some
nightmare realised in stone, over the entrance.
There is, if you do but consider it, a peculiar appropriateness
in the long, long stony frontage of the
Victualling yard being placed here, at Stonehouse,
and possibly a legend will be created dating the
inception of the name to the period when this
establishment was built; but the real original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
“Stone House,” was one built by a certain Joel,
Lord of the Manor in the far-off time of Henry the
Third.</p>

<p>Sir John Rennie, who designed and built the
massive range of the Victualling Yard, built for all
time. There are fifteen acres of it; comprising cattle-lairs
and cold-meat stores, gigantic corn and flour
stores, bakeries, rum stores, and dozens of other
departments from which the Navy is supplied.</p>

<p>Beyond the yard, the long creek, infinitely
muddy, of Stonehouse Lake opens out, and, across
the entrance, the military headquarters, Mount
Wise; semi-rural in appearance, its grassy slopes
crowned by signalling station and semaphore. The
name of “Mount Wise,” is no satirical nickname
holding up to ridicule the invincible incapacity of
the War Department, but a survival from the time
of Charles the Second, when the Wise family
owned the place. Another survival here is the
wooden signal semaphore, last of a line of thirty-two
that formed a “telegraphic” communication
between Plymouth and London in the days before
the electric telegraph was invented. To apply
the term “telegraph” to a series of wooden
semaphores sounds grotesque, but it is on record
that the arrival of Napoleon as a prisoner in
Plymouth Sound, in 1815, was “telegraphed” to
London in fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Here we are come to the great dockyard,
forming, with its recent extension at Keyham, a
continuous frontage facing the Hamoaze, of over
two miles. I suppose there are some five thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
men employed here by the Government in the
building and repairing of ships: a vast development
since 1691, when “Plymouth Dock,” was
first established. “Plymouth Dock,” the neighbourhood
remained until 1824, when the town that
had sprung up around the dockyard received the
newly-coined name of “Devonport.”</p>

<p>The steamers call at North Corner, hard by
the dockyard, where the grim streets of Devonport,
rich in pawnbrokers’ shops and public-houses,
dip down to the water, and dozens of naked boys
splash about on summer days in a longshore
mixture of sea water, mud, orange-peel, corks,
and all the miscellaneous flotsam and jetsam of
a great town.</p>

<p>North Corner is a busy place, and from the
steamer pontoon you look out upon all the activities
of the Hamoaze, with perhaps a great modern
battleship close inshore, come home, weather-stained,
from a long commission, and flying, from
her topmost truck, for all to notice, the paying-off
pennon; a ribbon of amazing length, reaching to
the waterline. Sailors, overjoyed to be home
again, come ashore with kitbags like great bolsters
on their shoulders, and look so bronzed, healthy
and happy that you are struck with astonishment
when, in some lowering, beetle-browed waterside
tavern, you hear them grumbling and advising
civilian and shore-going friends, with blazing
emphatics, “Don’t you never wear three rows of
tape round your neck,” which is a highly technical
way of saying, “Don’t join the Navy,” the blue-jacket’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
jumper being ornamented with three thin
white lines.</p>

<p>“A.B.’s no bloomin’ catch. All right for
petty orf’cer or articifer, fine thing to be a snotty,
or a lewtenant, an’ finer to be captain, or one o’
them admirals what ye see in the photograph
shops, cuddlin’ their telescopes under their arms,
and lookin’ as if they’d just come out o’ Sunday
School; but—well, here’s yours, my sonny.”</p>

<p class="caption">THE HAMOAZE.</p>
</div>

<p>Past North Corner and the steam-ferry across
the Hamoaze to Torpoint in Cornwall, you come
to Bull Point, where the explosives live, and to
the poor discarded ships of the Navy.</p>

<p>Here are tiers of vessels; steel-built cruisers,
gunboats, torpedo craft, and what not, at their
last moorings, and presently to be sold out of the
navy for the price of an old tin kettle.</p>

<p>There is nothing more pitiful in all this world
of activity than the sight of these discarded ships
of our modern navy. The old wooden men-o’-war,
out-of-date long generations ago, are still things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
of a worshipful nobility. Even the blackened
coal-hulks and the floating station of the Harbour
Police have the remains of a majestic presence;
but the obsolete cruisers and other vessels of the
present iron age are dreadfully abject and mean.
They have been in every clime, and on many a
distant station have upheld the dignity of the
Empire, and so have a claim upon our respect;
but no worn-out boiler or discarded kitchen-range,
among the rubbish-heaps of a builder’s
yard, looks so utterly and unromantically sordid.
For myself, I <i>want</i> to be impressed; I acutely wish
to read romance and the pathos of neglect into
these discarded things of iron and steel, that have
carried the King’s commission over all the seas
of the habitable globe and are now struck off
the effective list, even though they be not more
than twenty years old; but I find it impossible.
I could as easily—nay, could with greater ease—drop
a salt tear over the old kitchener that has
cooked me many a dinner, and now lies rusting
in the garden.</p>

<p>The ships look so small; and their sides and
decks are red with rust-stains. When quite
deserted they are even more than abject, and
resemble floating scrap-heaps, but when some
solitary figure of a marine is perceived, in charge,
pipe in mouth, and clad in the extraordinary
deshabille of undress that only a soldier will
descend to when removed from the eye of command,
and with intimate articles of his underclothing
drying in the sun, they wear the look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of sea-going slums. Figures and statistics do
not commonly impress me; you can make so
much play with an extra o or two, but here
are cruisers that have cost £150,000 a-piece which
will each fetch at auction only a trifling £5,000,
and for the mere look of them, would seem to be
extravagantly dear at £500; and when I think
of these things, I am very much impressed indeed.</p>

<p>The Hamoaze between St. Budeaux on the
Devonshire, and Saltash on the Cornish, shores,
becomes the Tamar, and narrows to something
a little less than half a mile wide. It is spanned
here by the famous Saltash Bridge, built by
Brunel to carry the railway across, and opened
in 1859. For eleven miles above the bridge, the
Tamar is navigable at high tide by small steamers,
past Cargreen, to Calstock, and past Morwellham
Quay, to Weir Head. Beyond, where New Bridge
carries the highway across, Devon and Cornwall
join hands.</p>

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
